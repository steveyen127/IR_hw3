A total of 3,258 participants who underwent biopsy ( including 1,902 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer ) were identified from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial . The associations of body mass index with prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer were examined using logistic regression , adjusting for age , race , body mass index adjusted prostate specific antigen , digital rectal examination , family history of prostate cancer , biopsy history , prostate specific antigen velocity , and time between study entry and the last biopsy . The prediction models were compared with our previously developed body mass index adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer risk calculator . Of the study subjects 49.1 % were overweight and 29.3 % were obese . After adjustment , among men without a known family history of prostate cancer , increased body mass index was not associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer ( per one-unit increase in logBMI OR 0.83 , p = 0.54 ) but was significantly associated with a higher risk of high grade prostate cancer ( ieGleason score 7 or greater prostate cancer ) ( OR 2.31 , p = 0.03 ) . For men with a known family history of prostate cancer the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer increased rapidly as body mass index increased ( prostate cancer OR 3.73 , p = 0.02 ; high grade prostate cancer OR 7.95 , p = 0.002 ) . The previously developed risk calculator generally underestimated the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer . Body mass index provided independently predictive information regarding the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer after adjusting for other risk factors . Body mass index , especially in men with a known family history of prostate cancer , should be considered for inclusion in any clinical assessment of prostate cancer risk and recommendations regarding prostate biopsy .\"\n",

This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers . All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas ( CMM , N = 28 069 ) and squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC , N = 24 620 ) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included . Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios ( SIR ) . Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer , accounting for residential region , education , income , parenthood , marital status and parental cancer status , using a 20 % random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference . Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers . During follow-up , 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer . SIR analyses showed 50 % and 90 % increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) . The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC ( 130 % ) . The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers , but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess : oral , lung , colon , breast , prostate , thyroid , leukemia , lymphoma and central nervous system . Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex , older age , lower residential latitude , being married and low education and income . Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC , but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors . Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers , which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise .\"\n",

However , concerns have been raised that the drug may increase the incidence of new primary malignancies , such as endometrial , liver , and colorectal cancers . Our goal was to assess the carcinogenic risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen in women with early stage breast cancer . The incidence of new primary cancers among 2729 women participants of the Stockholm Trial was determined at a median follow-up of 9 years . In this trial , after primary surgery , postmenopausal patients aged less than 71 years with unilateral invasive breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen ( 40 mg daily ) or no adjuvant endocrine therapy . Information on second cancers was obtained by retrospective linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry . To increase statistical power , a joint analysis of the incidence of endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers was performed in the following three major studies in Scandinavia evaluating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy : the Stockholm Trial , the Danish Breast Cancer Group Trial , and the South-Swedish Trial . These studies included a total of 4914 patients with a median follow-up of 8-9 years . All P values were calculated from two-tailed tests of statistical significance . In the Stockholm Trial , there was a statistically significant ( P = .008 ) reduction in the incidence of second primary cancers in the contralateral breast among the tamoxifen-treated patients . However , there was a nearly sixfold increase in endometrial cancers ( P < .001 ) and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers in the tamoxifen-treated patients . The results of the joint studies showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial cancers among the tamoxifen-treated patients ( relative risk  RR  = 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  = 1.9-8 .9 ) . There was also an excess of gastrointestinal cancers associated with tamoxifen . Most of this excess involved colorectal cancers ( RR = 1.9 ; 95 % CI = 1.1-3 .3 ) and stomach cancer ( RR = 3.2 ; 95 % CI = 0.9-11 .7 ) . There was no substantial increase in any other type of gastrointestinal cancer ( e.g. , liver cancer ) among the tamoxifen-treated patients . The endometrium and gastrointestinal organs may be target sites for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in humans . The increased incidence of colorectal and stomach cancers reported here should be regarded as tentative until supported by long-term data from a larger number of tamoxifen trials . Also , appropriate surveillance of cancer incidence is warranted for the protection of participants enrolled in current tamoxifen chemoprevention trials .\"\n",

To Live is God s Will is an effective , self-contained , cost-effective intervention to decrease cancer fatalism and increase knowledge of colorectal cancer ., The video was as effective as the ACS video on colorectal cancer in increasing participation in FOBT among rural elders . But , because Telling the Story ... To Live is God s Will also decreases cancer fatalism and increases knowledge , the potential exists for the increased screening behaviors to be maintained over time ., Showing the video in waiting areas of community health centers to facilitate the discussion of colorectal cancer and cancer screening with the healthcare professional is a possibility . Nursing students may benefit from using the video as a model for the integration of beliefs and attitudes in developing culturally appropriate , community-based interventions . More research is needed to determine if the positive outcomes of the intervention ( i.e. , decreased cancer fatalism , increased knowledge , increased participation in colorectal cancer screening ) can be maintained over time .\"\n",

            "  \"contents\" : \"Eastern Africa has the highest incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer worldwide . It is important to describe the differences among women and their perceived risk of cervical cancer to determine target groups to increase cervical cancer screening . In this cross-sectional study , we surveyed women seeking reproductive health services in Kisumu , Kenya to assess their perceived risk of cervical cancer and risk factors influencing cervical cancer screening uptake . statistics and t tests were used to determine significant factors , which were incorporated into a logistic model to determine factors independently associated with cervical cancer risk perception . Whereas 91 % of the surveyed women had heard of cancer , only 29 % of the 388 surveyed women had previously heard of cervical cancer . Most had received their information from health care workers . Few women ( 6 % ) had ever been screened for cervical cancer and cited barriers such as fear , time , and lack of knowledge about cervical cancer . Nearly all previously screened women ( 22/24  92 %  ) believed that cervical cancer was curable if detected early and that screening should be conducted annually ( 86 % ) . Most women ( 254/388  65 %  ) felt they were at risk for cervical cancer . Women with perceived risk of cervical cancer were older ( odds ratio  OR  , 1.06 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 1.02-1 .10 ) , reported a history of marriage ( OR , 2.08 ; CI , 1.00-4 .30 ) , were less likely to feel adequately informed about cervical cancer by health care providers ( OR , 0.76 ; CI , 0.18-0 .83 ) , and more likely to intend to have cervical cancer screening in the future ( OR , 10.59 ; CI , 3.96-28 .30 ) . Only 5 % of the women reported that they would not be willing to undergo screening regardless of cost . Cervical cancer is a major health burden for women in sub-Saharan Africa , yet only one third of the women had ever heard of cervical cancer in Kisumu , Kenya . Understanding factors associated with women s perceived risk of cervical cancer could guide future educational and clinical interventions to increase cervical cancer screening .,\"\n",

            "  \"contents\" : \"Recent posttrial analysis of a completed randomized trial found an increased risk of prostate cancer among healthy men taking high-dose vitamin E supplements . Trials that examined the effect of vitamin C supplements on cancer risk are few . We examined whether vitamin E or vitamin C supplementation affects the risk of cancer events during posttrial follow-up of the Physicians Health Study II ., Beginning in 1997 , a total of 14,641 US male physicians aged 50 y were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU of vitamin E every other day , 500 mg of vitamin C daily , or their respective placebos . The vitamin E and vitamin C treatment ended in 2007 , and observational follow-up continued through June 2011 . This study included an additional 356 cases of incident prostate cancer and 771 total cancers that developed during a mean ( maximum ) of 2.8 ( 3.8 ) y of posttrial observation . During an overall mean of 10.3 ( 13.8 ) y , there were a total of 1373 incident prostate cancers and 2669 total cancers documented . In comparison with placebo , vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer ( HR : 0.99 ; 95 % CI : 0.89 , 1.10 ) or total cancers ( HR : 1.02 ; 95 % CI : 0.95 , 1.10 ) . There was also no effect of vitamin C supplementation on total cancers ( HR : 1.02 ; 95 % CI : 0.94 , 1.10 ) or incident prostate cancer ( HR : 1.03 ; 95 % CI : 0.93 , 1.15 ) . Neither vitamin E nor vitamin C supplementation had effects on other site-specific cancers overall . Stratification by known cancer risk factors , history of cancer , other randomized treatment , and follow-up time showed no significant interactions . In this large-scale randomized trial in men , vitamin E and C supplementation had no immediate or long-term effects on the risk of total cancers , prostate cancer , or other site-specific cancers .\"\n",
