A total of 3,258 participants who underwent biopsy ( including 1,902 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer ) were identified from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial . The associations of body mass index with prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer were examined using logistic regression , adjusting for age , race , body mass index adjusted prostate specific antigen , digital rectal examination , family history of prostate cancer , biopsy history , prostate specific antigen velocity , and time between study entry and the last biopsy . The prediction models were compared with our previously developed body mass index adjusted Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial prostate cancer risk calculator . Of the study subjects 49.1 % were overweight and 29.3 % were obese . After adjustment , among men without a known family history of prostate cancer , increased body mass index was not associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer ( per one-unit increase in logBMI OR 0.83 , p = 0.54 ) but was significantly associated with a higher risk of high grade prostate cancer ( ieGleason score 7 or greater prostate cancer ) ( OR 2.31 , p = 0.03 ) . For men with a known family history of prostate cancer the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer increased rapidly as body mass index increased ( prostate cancer OR 3.73 , p = 0.02 ; high grade prostate cancer OR 7.95 , p = 0.002 ) . The previously developed risk calculator generally underestimated the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer . Body mass index provided independently predictive information regarding the risks of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer after adjusting for other risk factors . Body mass index , especially in men with a known family history of prostate cancer , should be considered for inclusion in any clinical assessment of prostate cancer risk and recommendations regarding prostate biopsy .\"\n",

This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers . All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas ( CMM , N = 28 069 ) and squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC , N = 24 620 ) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included . Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios ( SIR ) . Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer , accounting for residential region , education , income , parenthood , marital status and parental cancer status , using a 20 % random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference . Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers . During follow-up , 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer . SIR analyses showed 50 % and 90 % increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) . The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC ( 130 % ) . The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers , but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess : oral , lung , colon , breast , prostate , thyroid , leukemia , lymphoma and central nervous system . Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex , older age , lower residential latitude , being married and low education and income . Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC , but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors . Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers , which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise .\"\n",

However , concerns have been raised that the drug may increase the incidence of new primary malignancies , such as endometrial , liver , and colorectal cancers . Our goal was to assess the carcinogenic risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen in women with early stage breast cancer . The incidence of new primary cancers among 2729 women participants of the Stockholm Trial was determined at a median follow-up of 9 years . In this trial , after primary surgery , postmenopausal patients aged less than 71 years with unilateral invasive breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen ( 40 mg daily ) or no adjuvant endocrine therapy . Information on second cancers was obtained by retrospective linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry . To increase statistical power , a joint analysis of the incidence of endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers was performed in the following three major studies in Scandinavia evaluating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy : the Stockholm Trial , the Danish Breast Cancer Group Trial , and the South-Swedish Trial . These studies included a total of 4914 patients with a median follow-up of 8-9 years . All P values were calculated from two-tailed tests of statistical significance . In the Stockholm Trial , there was a statistically significant ( P = .008 ) reduction in the incidence of second primary cancers in the contralateral breast among the tamoxifen-treated patients . However , there was a nearly sixfold increase in endometrial cancers ( P < .001 ) and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers in the tamoxifen-treated patients . The results of the joint studies showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial cancers among the tamoxifen-treated patients ( relative risk  RR  = 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  = 1.9-8 .9 ) . There was also an excess of gastrointestinal cancers associated with tamoxifen . Most of this excess involved colorectal cancers ( RR = 1.9 ; 95 % CI = 1.1-3 .3 ) and stomach cancer ( RR = 3.2 ; 95 % CI = 0.9-11 .7 ) . There was no substantial increase in any other type of gastrointestinal cancer ( e.g. , liver cancer ) among the tamoxifen-treated patients . The endometrium and gastrointestinal organs may be target sites for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in humans . The increased incidence of colorectal and stomach cancers reported here should be regarded as tentative until supported by long-term data from a larger number of tamoxifen trials . Also , appropriate surveillance of cancer incidence is warranted for the protection of participants enrolled in current tamoxifen chemoprevention trials .\"\n",
