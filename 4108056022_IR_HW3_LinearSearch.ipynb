This study assesses ifosfamide pharmacokinetics ( PK ) according to two standard schedules . Using a 1:1 randomized trial design , we prospectively evaluated ifosfamide PK on two consecutive cycles of 3 g/m2/day for 3 days ( 9 g/m2/cycle ) given in one of two schedules either by continuous infusion ( CI ) or short ( 3 h ) infusion . Highly sensitive analytical methods allowed determination of concentrations of ifosfamide and the key metabolites 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide , 2 - and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide . Extensive PK analysis was available in 12 patients and showed equivalence between both schedules ( 3 h versus CI ) based on area under the curves ( micromol/l x h ) for ifosfamide , 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide , 2 - and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide ( 9,379 + / - 2,638 versus 8,307 + / - 1,995 , 152 + / - 59 versus 161 + / - 77 , 1,441 + / - 405 versus 1,388 + / - 393 , and 2,808 + / - 508 versus 2,634 + / - 508 , respectively , all P > 0.2 ) . The classical auto-induction of metabolism over the 3 days of infusion was confirmed for both schedules . This study confirms similar PK for both active and toxic metabolites of ifosfamide in adult cancer patients when 9 g/m2 of ifosfamide is administered over 3 days by CI or daily 3-h infusions . \" \n",

We evaluated the effect of a supplementary dose of radiation to the tumor bed on the rates of local recurrence among patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for early breast cancer . After lumpectomy and axillary dissection , patients with stage I or II breast cancer received 50 Gy of radiation to the whole breast in 2-Gy fractions over a five-week period . Patients with a microscopically complete excision were randomly assigned to receive either no further local treatment ( 2657 patients ) or an additional localized dose of 16 Gy , usually given in eight fractions by means of an external electron beam ( 2661 patients ) . During a median follow-up period of 5.1 years , local recurrences were observed in 182 of the 2657 patients in the standard-treatment group and 109 of the 2661 patients in the additional-radiation group . The five-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 7.3 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 6.8 to 7.6 percent ) and 4.3 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 3.8 to 4.7 percent ) , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) , yielding a hazard ratio for local recurrence of 0.59 ( 99 percent confidence interval , 0.43 to 0.81 ) associated with an additional dose . Patients 40 years old or younger benefited most ; at five years , their rate of local recurrence was 19.5 percent with standard treatment and 10.2 percent with additional radiation ( hazard ratio , 0.46  99 percent confidence interval , 0.23 to 0.89  ; P = 0.002 ) . At five years in the age group 41 to 50 years old , no differences were found in rates of metastasis or overall survival ( which were 87 and 91 percent , respectively ) .

We aimed to assess disease-free survival and overall survival after a median follow-up of 4 years for patients enrolled on the Herceptin Adjuvant ( HERA ) trial . The HERA trial is an international , multicentre , randomised , open-label , phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant , adjuvant chemotherapy , or both in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer . The primary endpoint was disease-free survival . After a positive first interim analysis at a median follow-up of 1 year for the comparison of treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year with observation , event-free patients in the observation group were allowed to cross over to receive trastuzumab . We report trial outcomes for the 1-year trastuzumab and observation groups at a median follow-up of 484 months ( IQR 420-565 ) and assess the effect of the extensive crossover to trastuzumab . Our analysis was by intention-to-treat . The HERA trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database , number 2005-002385-11 . The HERA trial population comprised 1698 patients randomly assigned to the observation group and 1703 to the 1-year trastuzumab group . Intention-to-treat analysis of disease-free survival showed a significant benefit in favour of patients in the 1-year trastuzumab group ( 4-year disease-free survival 786 % ) compared with the observation group ( 4-year disease-free survival 722 % ; hazard ratio  HR  076 ; 95 % CI 066-087 ; p < 00001 ) . Intention-to-treat analysis of overall survival showed no significant difference in the risk of death ( 4-year overall survival 893 % vs 877 % , respectively ; HR 085 ; 95 % CI 070-104 ; p = 011 ) . Overall , 885 patients ( 52 % ) of the 1698 patients in the observation group crossed over to receive trastuzumab , and began treatment at median 228 months ( range 45-527 ) from randomisation . In a non-randomised comparison , patients in the selective-crossover cohort had fewer disease-free survival events than patients remaining in the observation group ( adjusted HR 068 ; 95 % CI 051-090 ; p = 00077 ) . Higher incidences of grade 3-4 and fatal adverse events were noted on 1-year trastuzumab than in the observation group . The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events , each in less than 1 % of patients , were congestive cardiac failure , hypertension , arthralgia , back pain , central-line infection , hot flush , headache , and diarrhoea . Treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab for 1 year after chemotherapy is associated with significant clinical benefit at 4-year median follow-up . The substantial selective crossover of patients in the observation group to trastuzumab was associated with improved outcomes for this cohort . F Hoffmann-La Roche , Michelangelo Foundation . \" \n",

Differences in TCM measurements were compared using a t test . Subjects were followed a minimum of 2 years for local recurrence , disease-free survival , and overall survival . The mean difference in TCM measurements in the 2 groups was 0.88 mm , median of 1.00 mm ( treated ) and 2.10 mm , median of 2.4 mm ( untreated ) . The difference between the 2 groups was significant ( P = .0478 ) . Overall survival ( 100 % treated , 90.6 % controls at 5 years ) and disease-free survival ( 96.2 % treated , 86.8 % controls at 5 years ) were not significantly different in the 2 groups . This study of postirradiation breast cancer patients treated with PTX/vitamin E or standard follow-up indicated a significant difference in radiation-induced fibrosis as measured by TCM . There was no observed impact on local control or survival within the first 2 years of follow-up . The treatment was safe and well tolerated .

Of the 81 patients who received chemotherapy , 12 ( 15 % ) had serious adverse events . The most common adverse events were neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , and intestinal infection . Adjuvant chemotherapy should be recommended for patients with completely resected ILRR of breast cancer , especially if the recurrence is oestrogen-receptor negative .

            " \"content\" : \" This study evaluates the effect of acupuncture on hot flashes and disturbed night sleep in patients treated for breast cancer . The effect of acupuncture was tested against a sham-acupuncture group and a no-treatment control group . Plasma estradiol was measured to rule out this as cause of effect . Side effects of the treatment were registered . We randomized 94 women into the study : 31 had acupuncture , 29 had sham acupuncture and 34 had no treatment . In the acupuncture group , 16 patients ( 52 % ) experienced a significant effect on hot flashes compared with seven patients ( 24 % ) in the sham group ( p < 0.05 ) . The effect came after the second acupuncture session and lasted for at least 12 weeks after last treatment . A statistically significant positive effect was seen on sleep in the acupuncture group compared with the sham-acupuncture and no-treatment groups . The effect was not correlated with increased levels of plasma estradiol . No side effects of acupuncture were registered . We find that acupuncture significantly relieves hot flashes and sleep disturbances and is a good and safe treatment in women treated for breast cancer . \" \n",

In subsequent cycles vindesine was given every other week . For both treatments a maximum of six cycles was planned . Patients with performance status 0-2 according to the ECOG scale were enrolled . Response and toxicity were evaluated according to the WHO criteria . Analysis of clinical efficacy was performed according to an intent-to-treat analysis . No statistically significant differences in clinical efficacy were observed between the two chemotherapy regimens . The overall objective response rates were 39 % ( 95 % CL , 31-49 % ) in the VC arm and 42 % ( 95 % CL , 33-51 % ) in the MVP arm ( P = 0.13 ) . Median time to progression was 4.2 and 4.5 months for the MVP arm and the VC arm , respectively . Median overall survival was 7 months in the VC arm and 8 months in the MVP one ( log-rank test , P = 0.898 ) . These differences were not statistically significant . However , leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were significantly higher in the MVP arm than in the VC ( P = 0.0001 ; P = 0.0002 ) . Grade 3 alopecia was more frequent in the MVP arm than in the VC one ( P < 0.001 ) , which was associated with higher rate of phlebitis ( P = 0.037 ) . Data achieved in this study suggest that the vinorelbine-cisplatin doublet is similar to the three-drug MVP regimen in term of overall response rate , time to progressive disease , and overall survival . However , hematological toxicity and alopecia are more frequent and severe in the MVP regimen which therefore appears to be less tolerable than the VC regimen . The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin may be considered as a reference treatment for future studies on the treatment of advanced NSCLC . \" \n",

The objective of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of cytogenetic analysis in children and adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( HR-ALL ) included in a prospective multicenter trial . One hundred and thirty patients ( 44 children and 86 adults ) with HR-ALL included in the PETHEMA ALL-93 trial had an adequate cytogenetic study after review . Cytogenetic subgroups were established according to the cancer and acute leukemia group B criteria ( unfavorable : 11q23 , t ( 9 ; 22 ) , -7 and +8 ; normal ; miscellaneous : the remaining chromosome abnormalities ) and their main clinicobiological features were compared . Univariable and multivariable analyses for complete remission ( CR ) attainment , event-free survival ( EFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) were performed . The mean SD age was 26 14 years . Two were infants ( < 1 year ) , 42 were children and 86 adults ( 19-50 years ) . The cytogenetic study was normal in 44 ( 34 % ) cases . The most frequent chromosomal rearrangement was t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) ( 34 cases , 26 % , 30 adults ) , followed by 11q23 ( 12 cases , 9 % -8 children - , including t ( 4 ; 11 ) ( q21 ; q23 ) in 8 , 7 children ) . Patients with t ( 9 ; 22 ) were older than the remaining cases , whereas those with 11q23 rearrangements were younger and had higher WBC counts . Multivariable analyses showed two associated factors in adults with a lower frequency of CR and a shorter EFS and OS : t ( 9 ; 22 ) and slow response to therapy ( assessed by a percentage of blast cells higher than 10 % in bone marrow study on day 14 ) . For children with very high-risk ALL , only slow response to therapy ( assessed by the presence of blast cells in peripheral blood on day 8 ) was associated with a negative impact on CR , EFS and OS . In adult patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia included in the PETHEMA ALL-93 protocol , cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis is a useful independent prognostic marker . The poorest prognosis for patients with t ( 9 ; 22 ) justifies the development of specific treatments for these patients . In this small subgroup of children with very high-risk ALL no cytogenetic characteristics was found to influence the results of therapy , slow response to therapy being the only prognostic factor . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Surgery is of increasing importance in the treatment and outcome of diseases of the pancreas worldwide . The incidence of pancreatic cancer ( 7-11 / 100,000 per year ) has risen over the last years and surgical resection remains the only option for definite cure . Twenty-five percent of all resections are left of the superior mesenteric vein ( distal pancreatectomy ) and the appropriate closure technique for the pancreatic remnant remains unclear . Pancreatic fistulas are the most common ( 0-40 % ) and relevant postoperative complication . The optimal surgical strategy for pancreatic resection needs to be identified from the large number of surgical procedures available today . To evaluate the effectiveness of the two most common surgical techniques for distal pancreatectomy : stapler versus hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant . In order to account for the uncertainty and clinical heterogeneity in the management of the pancreatic remnant following distal pancreatectomy , a study protocol is developed on the basis of a retrospective survey of patients in a center of excellence for pancreatic surgery and a systematic review with meta-analysis . The DISPACT trial is a multicentered , randomized , controlled and patient-and observer-blinded trial using a two-group parallel group-sequential superiority design to compare the two techniques mentioned above . It will include approximately 336 randomized patients at up to 20 centers of excellence in pancreatic surgery , who are undergoing elective distal pancreatectomy for resectable benign , malign , and neuroendocrine tumors , chronic pancreatitis and pseudocysts of the pancreatic body and tail . The combination of the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula and mortality will be evaluated as the primary endpoint . In addition , a set of general and surgical parameters will be analyzed . Pre-specified treatment manuals and continuous intra-operative ( photo-documentation of surgical procedures and blinded evaluation thereafter ) and on-site monitoring will assure that the treatment of the study patients conforms to protocol and will minimize clinical heterogeneity . Due to uncertainties about the effect sizes of the primary endpoint , an a priori planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted after 224 evaluable patients are selected in order to reassess the initially planned sample size . Since pre-existing evidence was limited our initial sample size calculation is based on uncertain assumptions and may need to be modified in a planned interim analysis . Moreover , since surgical experience remains a potential confounder in surgical trials , learning curve bias has to be taken into account when analyzing the results . Given the participating trial sites , standardization of peri-and postoperative treatment represents a major issue of trial conduct . A group-sequential study design accounts for the uncertainty of pre-existing evidence . Also , standardization of surgical and postoperative care and blinded outcome assessment as well as adjustment for varying surgical expertise will contribute to a high validity and generalizability of the results . \" \n",

The results are compared with the existing literature . Between November 2000 and September 2002 , 181 women with early stage breast cancer underwent primary surgery following preoperative randomisation into two groups , a `` standard group ( SN biopsy was followed by ALND ) and a study group ( surgical procedure consisting of only SN biopsy when histologically metastasis-free SN was present ) ., Follow-up data ( 362 sessions ; 6 months to 3 years after primary surgery ) were available from 150 patients . A summary morbidity score was calculated from four subjective ( arm-strength , arm-mobility , arm swelling , pain ) and four objective ( arm-strength , arm-mobility , lymphedema , sensitivity ) criteria . Fifty seven patients underwent SN biopsy only . Ninety three patients underwent ALND , 57 of which had lymph nodes free of metastasis and 36 had lymph nodes with metastasis and axillary clearing . Shoulder-arm morbidity was significantly different between the groups . Patients treated with SN biopsy only scored better on subjective and objective criteria . Postsurgical shoulder-arm morbidity is a major long-term problem in patients undergoing surgical treatment for breast cancer .

However , dedicated clinical research has not defined a predictive role for TP53 gene mutations . The aim of the current study was to retrospectively explore the prognosis and predictive values of TP53 somatic mutations in the BIG 02-98 randomized phase III trial in which women with node-positive breast cancer were treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel . The prognostic and predictive values of TP53 were analyzed in tumor samples by gene sequencing within exons 5 to 8 . Patients were classified according to p53 protein status predicted from TP53 gene sequence , as wild-type ( no TP53 variation or TP53 variations which are predicted not to modify p53 protein sequence ) or mutant ( p53 nonsynonymous mutations ) . Mutations were subcategorized according to missense or truncating mutations . Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test . Cox-regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of outcome . TP53 gene status was determined for 18 % ( 520 of 2887 ) of the women enrolled in BIG 02-98 . TP53 gene variations were found in 17 % ( 90 of 520 ) . Nonsynonymous p53 mutations , found in 16.3 % ( 85 of 520 ) , were associated with older age , ductal morphology , higher grade and hormone-receptor negativity . Of the nonsynonymous mutations , 12.3 % ( 64 of 520 ) were missense and 3.6 % were truncating ( 19 of 520 ) . Only truncating mutations showed significant independent prognostic value , with an increased recurrence risk compared to patients with non-modified p53 protein ( hazard ratio = 3.21 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.740 to 5.935 , P = 0.0002 ) . p53 status had no significant predictive value for response to docetaxel . p53 truncating mutations were uncommon but associated with poor prognosis .

            " \"content\" : \" The probability of response to chemotherapy following platinum based treatment in ovarian cancer has usually been related to the ` platinum-free interval ., However , in a recent European-Canadian trial of paclitaxel , serous histology , tumor bulk , and hemoglobin , but not treatment free interval , were predictors of response . To determine if these observations were unique to this study ( or this drug ) , data from other active agents given as second - or third-line treatment in ovarian cancer were obtained and analyzed . In the first part of the study , results of trials in 1185 platinum pretreated ovarian cancer patients were obtained on six agents : paclitaxel , epirubicin , docetaxel , carboplatin , irinotecan , and gemcitabine . Response results according to histology , baseline hemoglobin , tumor size and time from last chemotherapy were determined for each agent and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used to obtain an overall assessment of significance for each factor . In the second part of the study , individual data from 704 patients in four studies ( three agents : paclitaxel , docetaxel and epirubicin ) were pooled for univariate and multivariate analysis of factors predictive of response . In the analysis of results of individual agents all factors examined were significant predictors of response : serous histology ( P = 0.001 ) , tumor size < or = 5 cm ( P = 0.02 ) , normal baseline hemoglobin ( P = 0.003 ) , and > or = 6 mo since last treatment ( P = 0.001 ) . While these results were interesting , they did not supply definitive answers regarding independent response predictors . Therefore a multifactor analysis was undertaken on the 704 patients for whom individual data were available . Of the 11 factors examined in a univariate analysis , 10 met the criteria for inclusion in a stepwise logistic regression . In the final model only 3 factors remained as significant independent predictors of response : serous histology ( P = 0.009 ) , no . disease sites ( P = 0.003 ) , and tumor size ( P = 0.001 ) . Time from last treatment , when evaluated as a continuous variable , was not in the final model and was highly correlated with tumor size ( P = 0.0005 ) . On the basis of this analysis , we conclude that tumor burden ( as assessed by size of the largest lesion and number of disease sites ) and histology are factors of importance in response to subsequent chemotherapy in relapsed ovarian cancer . Time from last treatment was correlated with tumor size in this data set and its effect on response was dependent on whether it was examined as a categorical or continuous variable , so we conclude it is not the sole critical factor of biologic importance . We recommend description of these factors in reports of phase II studies , confirmation of these findings in other data sets and further investigation of the mechanism of sensitivity of serous tumors . \" \n",

The protocol treatment randomization was RT alone versus RT plus short-course ( approximately 4 months ) neoadjuvant and concurrent total androgen blockade ( RT+TAB ) . The study population consisted of 149 patients , of whom 74 received RT alone and 75 received RT+TAB . DNA content was determined by image analysis of Feulgen stained tissue sections ; 94 patients were diploid and 55 patients were nondiploid . Kaplan-Meier univariate survival , the cumulative incidence method , and Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the relationship of DNA ploidy to distant metastasis and overall survival . DNA nondiploidy was not associated with any of the other prognostic factors in univariate analyses . In Kaplan-Meier analyses , 5-year overall survival was 70 % for those with diploid tumors and 42 % for nondiploid tumors . Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that nondiploidy was independently associated with reduced overall survival . No correlation was observed between DNA ploidy and distant metastasis . The diminished survival in the absence of an increase in distant metastasis was related to a reduction in the effect of salvage androgen ablation ; patients treated initially with RT+TAB and who had nondiploid tumors had reduced survival after salvage androgen ablation . Nondiploidy was associated with shorter survival , which seemed to be related to reduced response to salvage hormone therapy for those previously exposed to short-term TAB . \" \n",

In each treatment arm , changes in different markers were associated with progression risk . For example , increases in IL-8 with VCP , MMP-9 with CP , and VEGF with vandetanib monotherapy were associated with increased progression risk , and increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with vandetanib was associated with decreased risk . Vandetanib and chemotherapy treatment led to distinct patterns of CAF changes ; the combination resembled chemotherapy alone .

            " \"content\" : \" Concomitant genetic alterations could account for transient clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) in patients harboring activating EGFR mutations . We have evaluated the impact of pretreatment somatic EGFR T790M mutations , TP53 mutations , and Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death ( BCL2L11 , also known as BIM ) mRNA expression in 95 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) included in the EURTAC trial ( trial registration : NCT00446225 ) . T790M mutations were detected in 65.26 % of patients using our highly sensitive method based on laser microdissection and peptide-nucleic acid-clamping PCR , which can detect the mutation at an allelic dilution of 1 in 5,000 . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) to erlotinib was 9.7 months for those with T790M mutations and 15.8 months for those without , whereas among patients receiving chemotherapy , it was 6 and 5.1 months , respectively ( P < 0.0001 ) . PFS to erlotinib was 12.9 months for those with high and 7.2 months for those with low/intermediate BCL2L11 expression levels , whereas among chemotherapy-treated patients , it was 5.8 and 5.5 months , respectively ( P = 0.0003 ) . Overall survival was 28.6 months for patients with high BCL2L11 expression and 22.1 months for those with low/intermediate BCL2L11 expression ( P = 0.0364 ) . Multivariate analyses showed that erlotinib was a marker of longer PFS ( HR = 0.35 ; P = 0.0003 ) , whereas high BCL2L11 expression was a marker of longer PFS ( HR = 0.49 ; P = 0.0122 ) and overall survival ( HR = 0.53 ; P = 0.0323 ) . Low-level pretreatment T790M mutations can frequently be detected and can be used for customizing treatment with T790M-specific inhibitors . BCL2L11 mRNA expression is a biomarker of survival in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and can potentially be used for synthetic lethality therapies . \" \n",

In addition to promoting health for the general population , a cancer diagnosis may provide a `` teachable moment , facilitating the adoption of more healthful eating habits and leading to lower risk of chronic disease and better overall health ., This study was designed to test the effectiveness of two health communication interventions in increasing F&V consumption and physical activity in a sample of older adults ( average age of 66 years ) , including both colorectal cancer ( CRC ) survivors and noncolorectal cancer-affected ( N-CRC ) individuals . CRC survivors and N-CRC individuals were recruited from a population-based case-control study and randomly assigned to four conditions using a 2 x 2 design . We tested two different methods of communicating and promoting health behavior change alone or in combination : tailored print communication ( TPC ) and brief telephone-based motivational interviewing ( TMI ) . A significant increase in F&V consumption was found for the combined intervention group in the entire sample ( p < 0.05 ) . When stratified by cancer survivor status , the effect was concentrated in the N-CRC subset ( p < 0.01 ) versus CRC survivors . The combined intervention was also found to be most cost-effective for the N-CRC group , with TPC more cost-effective than TMI . For physical activity , none of the interventions produced statistically significant improvements . This study indicates that combining tailoring and motivational interviewing may be an effective and cost-effective method for promoting dietary behavior change among older healthy adults . More research is needed to identify the optimal dose and timing for intervention strategies to promote dietary and physical activity change among both CRC survivors and the general population . \" \n",

Identifying the cause of ARF is crucial . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage ( FO-BAL ) is an invasive test that may cause respiratory deterioration . Recent noninvasive diagnostic tests may have modified the risk/benefit ratio of FO-BAL . To determine whether FO-BAL in cancer patients with ARF increased the need for intubation and whether noninvasive testing alone was not inferior to noninvasive testing plus FO-BAL . We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial with sample size calculations for both end points . Patients with cancer and ARF of unknown cause who were not receiving ventilatory support at intensive care unit admission were randomized to early FO-BAL plus noninvasive tests ( n = 113 ) or noninvasive tests only ( n = 106 ) . The primary end point was the number of patients needing intubation and mechanical ventilation . The major secondary end point was the number of patients with no identified cause of ARF . The need for mechanical ventilation was not significantly greater in the FO-BAL group than in the noninvasive group ( 35.4 vs. 38.7 % ; P = 0.62 ) . The proportion of patients with no diagnosis was not smaller in the noninvasive group ( 21.7 vs. 20.4 % ; difference , -1.3 %  -10.4 to 7.7  ) .

To explore user characteristics associated with the use of different system components of a Web-based illness management support system for cancer patients ( WebChoice ) . For this secondary post hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) , in which WebChoice was tested among 325 breast cancer and prostate cancer patients who were followed with repeated measures for 1 year , usage patterns of 162 cancer patients in the intervention arm with access to WebChoice were extracted from the user log . Logistic regression was performed to identify patterns of associations between system use and patient characteristics . Latent class analyses ( LCA ) were performed to identify associations among the use of different system components and levels of social support , symptom distress , depression , self-efficacy , and health-related quality of life . Approximately two-thirds ( 103/162 , 63.6 % ) of the patients logged on to WebChoice more than once , and were defined as users . A high level of computer experience ( odds ratio  OR  3.77 , 95 % CI 1.20-11 .91 ) and not having other illnesses in addition to cancer ( OR 2.10 , 95 % CI 1.02-4 .34 ) increased the overall probability of using WebChoice . LCA showed that both men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer who had low scores on social support accompanied with high levels of symptom distress and high levels of depression were more likely to use the e-message component . For men with prostate cancer , these variables were also associated with high use of the self-management advice component . We found important differences between men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer when associations between WebChoice use and each user characteristic were analyzed separately . High use of all components was associated with low levels of social support among women with breast cancer , but not among men with prostate cancer . High use of e-messages , advice , and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of depression among women with breast cancer , but not among men with prostate cancer . For men with prostate cancer ( but not women with breast cancer ) , high use of symptom assessments , advice , and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of symptom distress . However , it is unclear whether these findings can be attributed to differences related to diagnosis , gender , or both . This study provides evidence that different user characteristics are associated with different use patterns . Such information is crucial to target Web-based support systems to different patient groups . LCA is a useful technique to identify subgroups of users . In our study , e-messages and self-management advice were highly used components for patients who had low levels of social support and high illness burden , suggesting that patients with these characteristics may find such tools particularly useful .

Fifty-three patients scheduled for a right hemicolectomy due to a right-sided colon cancer were randomized to a median vertical ( M ) or a transverse incision ( T ) . Forty patients , 23 with a M and 17 with a T incision , completed the study and could be evaluated . Pain at rest and after physical activity was assessed with a visual analogue scale , and was also measured as reflected in the need for analgesics . Respiratory function was assessed with pre - and post-operative spirometry . Pain after activity was significantly less in patients with a T incision . This group also needed less analgesia . Vital capacity ( VC ) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV 1.0 ) were profoundly reduced after surgery in both groups of patients , but improvement of respiratory function was faster in patients with a transverse incision . No problem with access to the operative field was noted . We conclude that a transverse incision is preferable to a midline incision and should be used in right hemicolectomy . This abdominal incision reduces effort-induced pain and interferes less with post-operative pulmonary function , and may reduce the risk of pulmonary complications . \" \n",

Among 143 evaluable patients , there were no cases of endometrial thickness > 10 mm with exemestane , vs. 11 cases with tamoxifen ( p < 0.0003 ) . There was a significant difference between the treatment groups regarding time to endometrial thickness > 10mm , in favour of exemestane ( p < 0.0001 ) . Time to endometrial thickness > 5 mm was significantly longer for exemestane than for tamoxifen ( p < 0.0001 ) . Median time to endometrial thickness > 5 mm or censoring was 583 days in the exemestane group versus 315 days in the tamoxifen group . There were also significantly fewer incidences of endometrial thickness > 5 mm at month 6 and month 12 with exemestane compared to tamoxifen ( tamoxifen : 6 % and 2 % ; exemestane : 29 % and 39 % , respectively ) . After 12 months , mean increases in endometrial thickness from baseline were 2.64 mm and 6.0 mm in the exemestane and tamoxifen groups , respectively ( p < 0.0006 ) . Moreover , 17 histologically confirmed endometrial changes were observed in the tamoxifen group , vs. one in the exemestane group . Exemestane was associated with significantly less endometrial thickening than tamoxifen during adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Megestrol acetate has been reported to improve appetite and quality of life and to decrease nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer anorexia/cachexia . The present trial was formulated to evaluate the impact of megestrol acetate on quality of life , toxicity , response , and survival in individuals with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who received concomitant chemotherapy . Patients were randomized to receive megestrol acetate 800 mg/d orally or placebo . In addition , all patients were scheduled to receive a maximum of four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy . Quality of life was self-assessed at entry onto study , with every cycle of chemotherapy , and 4 months thereafter with a linear visual analog scale . Toxicity was evaluated by patient questionnaire and investigator reports . A total of 243 eligible patients were randomized . Those who received megestrol acetate had increased nonfluid weight gain ( P = .004 ) and significantly less nausea ( P = .0002 ) and vomiting ( P = .02 ) . Significant thromboembolic phenomena occurred more often in patients who received megestrol acetate versus placebo ( 9 % v 2 % , P = .01 ) . Patients who received megestrol acetate had more edema ( 30 % v 20 % , P = .002 ) , an inferior response rate to chemotherapy ( 68 % v 80 % , P = .03 ) , and a trend for inferior survival duration ( median , 8.2 v 10.0 months , P = .49 ) . These findings may have been influenced by a poorer quality of life of the megestrol acetate group at study initiation . There were no significant changes in quality of life scores over time between either of the study arms . Megestrol acetate can not be routinely recommended for all patients with small-cell lung cancer at the time of chemotherapy initiation . Rather , its therapeutic ratio may be more favorable for patients with problematic cancer anorexia/cachexia . \" \n",

Nevertheless , some of them discuss completion surgery ( hysterectomy  HT  ) after CRT . The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic impact of such surgery . A randomized trial was opened in France in 2003 to evaluate the interest in HT after CRT . Inclusion criteria were : ( a ) stage IB2 or II cervical cancer without extrapelvic disease on conventional imaging ; ( b ) pelvic external radiation therapy ( 45 Gy with or without parametrial or nodal boost ) with concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy ( 40 mg/m2 per week ) followed by uterovaginal brachytherapy ( 15 Gy to the intermediate risk clinical target volume ) ; and ( c ) complete clinical and radiological response 6-8 weeks after brachytherapy . Patients were randomized between HT ( arm A ) and no HT ( arm B ) . Unfortunately this trial was closed because of poor accrual : 61 patients were enrolled ( in 2003-2006 ) and are reported on here . Thirty one and 30 patients were enrolled , respectively , in arm A and arm B. Twelve patients recurred ( five of them died ) : respectively , eight and four in arm A and arm B. The 3-year event-free survival rates were 72 % ( standard error  SE  , 9 % ) and 89 % ( SE , 6 % ) ( not significant  NS  ) in arm A and arm B , respectively . The 3-year overall survival rates were 86 % ( SE , 6 % ) and 97 % ( SE , 3 % ) ( NS ) in arm A and arm B , respectively . Results of the current trial seem to suggest that completion HT had no therapeutic impact in patients with clinical and radiological complete response after CRT ( but this conclusion is limited by the lack of power ) . \" \n",

One hundred nine patients , with inoperable abdominal or pelvic cancer , reporting visceral pain of 40-70 on a visual analogue scale and taking nonopioid analgesics were allocated randomly into two groups : either blocks were performed before Step 2 of the WHO ladder , then analgesics were managed according to the ladder ( Group I ) or analgesics were given according to the WHO ladder , and blocks were performed as the fourth step after failure of strong opioids to control pain ( Group II ) . Visual analogue scale scores , responder analysis , daily opioid consumption , related side effects , and quality of life were assessed . Responders were significantly higher in Group I ( P < 0.0001 ) , and partial responders and nonresponders significantly increased in Group II ( P < 0.0001 and 0.006 , respectively ) . Opioid consumption significantly decreased in Group I ( P < 0.0001 during first 12 months and 0.007 at the last assessment time ) , with concomitant significant reduction in related side effects . The number of patients who had a good analgesic response on tramadol significantly increased in Group I during the first five months ( P < 0.05 ) .

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty compared with non-surgical management for patients with cancer who have painful VCFs . The Cancer Patient Fracture Evaluation ( CAFE ) study was a randomised controlled trial at 22 sites in Europe , the USA , Canada , and Australia . We enrolled patients aged at least 21 years who had cancer and one to three painful VCFs . Patients were randomly assigned by a computer-generated minimisation randomisation algorithm to kyphoplasty or non-surgical management ( control group ) . Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment allocation . The primary endpoint was back-specific functional status measured by the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire ( RDQ ) score at 1 month . Outcomes at 1 month were analysed by modified intention to treat , including all patients with data available at baseline and at 1 month follow-up . Patients in the control group were allowed to crossover to receive kyphoplasty after 1 month . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00211237 . Between May 16 , 2005 , and March 11 , 2008 , 134 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to kyphoplasty ( n = 70 ) or non-surgical management ( n = 64 ) . 65 patients in the kyphoplasty group and 52 in the control group had data available at 1 month . The mean RDQ score in the kyphoplasty group changed from 176 at baseline to 91 at 1 month ( mean change -83 points , 95 % CI -64 to -102 ; p < 00001 ) . The mean score in the control group changed from 182 to 180 ( mean change 01 points ; 95 % CI -08 to 10 ; p = 083 ) . At 1 month , the kyphoplasty treatment effect for RDQ was -84 points ( 95 % CI -76 to -92 ; p < 00001 ) . The most common adverse events within the first month were back pain ( four of 70 in the kyphoplasty group and five of 64 in the control group ) and symptomatic vertebral fracture ( two and three , respectively ) . One patient in the kyphoplasty group had an intraoperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction , which resolved and was attributed to anaesthesia .

However , most women are unaware that inconsequential disease can also be detected by screening , leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment . We aimed to investigate whether including information about overdetection of breast cancer in a decision aid would help women aged around 50 years to make an informed choice about breast screening . We did a community-based , parallel-group , randomised controlled trial in New South Wales , Australia , using a random cohort of women aged 48-50 years . Recruitment to the study was done by telephone ; women were eligible if they had not had mammography in the past 2 years and did not have a personal or strong family history of breast cancer . With a computer program , we randomly assigned 879 participants to either the intervention decision aid ( comprising evidence-based explanatory and quantitative information on overdetection , breast cancer mortality reduction , and false positives ) or a control decision aid ( including information on breast cancer mortality reduction and false positives ) . Participants and interviewers were masked to group assignment . The primary outcome was informed choice ( defined as adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening intentions ) , which we assessed by telephone interview about 3 weeks after random allocation . The primary outcome was analysed in all women who completed the relevant follow-up interview questions fully . This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN12613001035718 . Between January , 2014 , and July , 2014 , 440 women were allocated to the intervention group and 439 were assigned to the control group . 21 women in the intervention group and 20 controls were lost to follow-up ; a further ten women assigned to the intervention and 11 controls did not answer all questions on attitudes .

Adjuvant FOLFIRI resulted in a 3-year DFS less than that expected for FOLFOX . In this small randomized subset of patients with resected stage III colon cancer , the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward improved DFS and OS . Nevertheless , considering the limitations of this analysis , FOLFOX without the addition of a biologic agent remains the standard of care for adjuvant therapy in resected stage III colon cancer . \" \n",

The study involved 95 primary care clinicians in eight Veterans Affairs medical centers from January 2007 to February 2009 . Participants were randomized into two cohorts : spaced education clinicians received four isomorphic cycles of nine e-mails over 36 weeks ( zero to two e-mails per week ) , whereas control clinicians received no intervention . Each e-mail presented a clinical scenario and asked whether it was appropriate to obtain a PSA test . Participants received immediate feedback after submitting their answers . The primary outcome was the number and percentage of inappropriate PSA screening tests ordered . Inappropriate testing was defined as use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients aged > 76 or < 40 years . Appropriateness of screening was dichotomized based on patient age at time of screening . Patients with PSA testing for non-screening reasons were excluded using a validated protocol . Logistic regression with adjustment for patient clustering by clinician was performed . Analyses were conducted in 2009 . During the intervention period ( Weeks 1-36 ) , clinicians receiving spaced education e-mails ordered significantly fewer inappropriate PSA screening tests than control clinicians ( 10.5 % vs 14.2 % , p = 0.041 ) . Over the 72-week period following the intervention ( Weeks 37-108 ) , spaced education clinicians continued to order fewer inappropriate tests compared to controls ( 7.8 % vs 13.1 % , respectively , p = 0.011 ) , representing a 40 % relative reduction in inappropriate screening .

The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) conducted a randomized trial ( EORTC 10854 ) to compare surgery followed by one course of PeCT ( fluorouracil , doxorubicin , and cyclophosphamide ) with surgery alone . From patients treated on this trial , we selected premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer who were treated with BCT to examine whether histologic characteristics and the expression of various proteins ( estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , p53 , Ki-67 , bcl-2 , CD31 , c-erbB-2 / neu ) are risk factors for subsequent LR . Also , the effect of one course of PeCT on the LR risk ( LRR ) was studied .

Patients younger than 43 years who received PeCT achieved similar LR rates as those of patients younger than 43 years who were treated with BCT alone . In premenopausal node-negative patients , age younger than 43 years is the most important risk factor for LR after BCT ; this risk is greatly reduced by one course of PeCT . The main reason for administering systemic adjuvant treatment is to improve overall survival . The important reduction of LR after BCT is an additional reason for considering systemic treatment in young node-negative patients with breast cancer . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Although a novel technique for the performance of intestinal sutureless anastomosis using a compression device has recently been investigated , it has not yet received widespread acceptance . We performed a multicenter prospective randomized trial in order to determine the clinical efficacy of the NiTi Hand CAC 30 , a type of compression anastomosis clip ( CAC ) , for jejunojejunostomy in gastric cancer surgery . Forty-seven patients from 6 institutions , who were diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma , were enrolled ; these patients were randomized to a CAC group and a hand-sewn ( control ) group . Three patients dropped out for various reasons , and results for 44 patients were finally analyzed . The CAC group consisted of 20 patients , and there were 24 patients in the control group . Anastomosis time , the primary endpoint of this trial , was shorter in the CAC group than in the control group ( P < 0.001 ) . However , total operation times ( P = 0.055 ) did not differ . All reconstructions were completed by Roux-en-Y anastomosis , and the complication rates of the two groups did not differ ( P = 0.908 ) ; however , jejunojejunostomy leakage occurred in two patients in the CAC group . Our prospective multicenter clinical trial showed that the use of the NiTi Hand CAC 30 for jejunojejunostomy in gastric cancer surgery was feasible and could reduce anastomosis time . However , considering that there were two cases of leakage , extended use of the NiTi Hand CAC 30 should be carefully applied . \" \n",

Detailed health-related quality of life measures were taken as part of a trial of follow-up of patients with colon cancer by general practitioners and surgeons . This study was designed as a longitudinal assessment of health-related quality of life after treatment for carcinoma of the colon and patient satisfaction with two different settings of follow-up ( general practitioners vs. surgeons ) . A total of 338 patients were recruited into randomized ( n = 203 ) and patient preference ( n = 135 ) follow-up groups . Prospectively assessed physical and mental health-related quality of life measures and patient satisfaction are reported during two years . Elderly and less educated patients prefer follow-up by general practitioners over surgeons . Overall , physical health-related quality of life is reduced early after treatment ; however , this returns to normal levels at one year . Mental quality of life , anxiety , and depression are at or above population levels throughout the two-year follow-up period . There were no differences in physical or psychologic health-related quality of life measures between general practitioner and surgeon groups at any time during follow-up . Overall , more advanced Dukes stage is associated with a trend to improved mental health-related quality of life . Patients ability to choose the setting of follow-up has no influence on health-related quality of life compared with random allocation to general practitioner or surgeon ., Patients are equally highly satisfied with follow-up by general practitioner or surgeon . After recovery from treatment for colon cancer , health-related quality of life is similar to the general population . Good health-related quality of life outcomes and high patient satisfaction are as well provided by general practitioners in the community setting as by surgeon review . \" \n",

Smoking characteristics , patient demographics , and physician-diagnosed cardiovascular events were collected . Images were acquired without electrocardiography gating on 16-slice CT scanners . The association between the presence of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and the predictors was quantified using Cox proportional hazard analysis . Median follow-up period was 2.9 years . Incident cardiovascular events occurred in 186 participants . Adjusted hazard ratios for modified Agatston score strata of 1 to 10 , 11 to 100 , 101 to 400 , and > 400 were 3.39 ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 1.20-9 .59 ) , 6.52 ( 95 % CI , 2.73-15 .60 ) , 6.58 ( 95 % CI , 2.75-15 .78 ) , and 12.58 ( 95 % CI , 5.42-29 .16 ) , respectively . Moreover , comparing the models with and without modified Agatston score strata to the model with age , pack-years , and smoking status yielded a significantly better net reclassification improvement ( NRI ; 27.3 % ; P < .0001 ) . Adding the number of calcifications to the model with age , pack-years , smoking status , and modified Agatston score strata resulted in a slightly better NRI ( 1.68 % ; P = .0490 ) with a hazard ratio of 1.13 ( 95 % CI , 1.05-1 .21 ) per 10 calcifications . The incremental prognostic information contained in the volume of the largest calcification was not statistically significant ( NRI , 0.14 % ; P = .3458 ) . Cardiovascular event rate increased with higher numbers of calcified lesions . The number but not maximum volume of calcifications has independent , although minimal , prognostic value over age , pack-years , smoking status , and modified Agatston score strata in our population . \" \n",

It is a reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor and inhibits cell proliferation , growth , migration , invasion and survival . This study was performed for the subsequent marketing of a test erlotinib formulation in Korea . We evaluated the comparative bioavailability and tolerability of the test and reference formulations in healthy adult volunteers . A total of 46 healthy male subjects were enrolled in a single-dose , randomized , open-label , two-period , two-sequence , crossover , bioequivalence study . During each treatment period , subjects received 150 mg of erlotinib in either the test or reference formulation . There was a 2-week washout period between each period . Blood samples were obtained 15 times during each period , before dosing and 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 h after oral administration . Plasma concentrations of erlotinib were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . Pharmacokinetic parameters , including maximum plasma concentration ( C ( max ) ) , area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last sampling time ( AUC ( t ) ) , AUC from time zero to infinity ( AUC ( ) ) , and time to reach C ( max ) ( t ( max ) ) , were measured , and all treatment-emergent adverse events and their relationships with the study medications were recorded throughout the study . An additional analysis was performed to characterize the association between the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A1 , CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 genotypes and the erlotinib pharmacokinetic parameters . A total of 41 subjects completed the study . There were no significant differences in the prevalence of adverse events between the two formulations , and there were no serious or unexpected adverse events during the study . Both formulations had very similar C ( max ) , AUC , terminal half-life ( t ) and t ( max ) values . The 90 % confidence intervals of the geometric least-squares mean ratios of the test to reference formulation were 1.09 ( 0.98-1 .22 ) for C ( max ) and 1.10 ( 1.01-1 .21 ) for AUCt . Statistical significance was observed between the CYP1A2 * 1M genotype and the erlotinib pharmacokinetic parameter , particularly C ( max ) ( p = 0.015 ) . This study suggests that the test and reference formulations of 150 mg erlotinib have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics . Both had no major safety issues and were well-tolerated . The test formulation met the regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to the reference formulation for both AUCt and C max . The additional genetic analysis demonstrated that the major metabolic enzymes of erlotinib did not significantly affect erlotinib metabolism , with the exception of CYP1A2 * 1M . \" \n",

We hypothesized that selecting patients at risk of FN might increase the cost-effectiveness of GCSF prophylaxis . Economic analysis was conducted alongside the clinical trial and was focused on the health care perspective . Primary outcome was the difference in mean total costs per patient in cycle 1 between both prophylactic strategies . Cost-effectiveness was expressed as costs per percent-FN-prevented . For the first cycle , the mean incremental costs of adding GCSF amounted to 681 euro ( 95 % CI , -36 to 1,397 euro ) per patient . For the entire treatment period , the mean incremental costs were substantial ( 5,123 euro ; 95 % CI , 3,908 to 6,337 euro ) , despite a significant reduction in the incidence of FN and related savings in medical care consumption . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 50 euro per percent decrease of the probability of FN ( 95 % CI , -2 to 433 euro ) in cycle 1 , and the acceptability for this willingness to pay was approximately 50 % . Despite the selection of patients at risk of FN , the addition of GCSF to primary antibiotic prophylaxis did not result in cost savings . If policy makers are willing to pay 240 euro for each percent gain in effect ( ie , 3,360 euro for a 14 % reduction in FN ) , the addition of GCSF can be considered cost effective . \" \n",

The Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer in Japan , a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant S-1 therapy for resected gastric cancer , demonstrated significant improvement in overall and relapse-free survival , compared to surgery alone . To evaluate value for money of S-1 therapy , cost-effective analysis was carried out . The analysis was carried out from a payer s perspective ., As an economic measure , cost per quality-adjusted life-year ( QALY ) gained was estimated . Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method , up to 5-year observation . Beyond this period , it was simulated by the modified Boag model . Utility score is derived from interviews with sampled patients using a time trade-off method . Costs were estimated from trial data during observation , while in the period beyond observation they were estimated using simulation results . To explore uncertainty of the results , qualitative and stochastic sensitivity analyses were done . Adjuvant S-1 therapy gained 1.24 QALYs per patient and increased costs by $ 3,722 per patient for over lifetime ( 3 % discount rate for both effect and costs ) . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( 95 % confidence intervals ) for over lifetime was estimated to be $ 3,016 ( $ 1,441 , $ 8,840 ) per QALY . The sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of these results . Adjuvant S-1 therapy for curatively resected gastric cancer is likely cost-effective .

From 2009 to 2014 , we conducted a dbRCT including 60 patients with primary mHGPIN and/or ASAP receiving daily lycopene 35mg , selenium 55g , and GTCs 600mg , or placebo for 6 months . Pharmacokinetic analysis were performed with UV-Visible spectrophotometric assay under standard ( SC ) and accelerated ( AC ) conditions . Upon plasma lycopene concentrations falling within the expected range ( 1.2-90mcg / l ) and no side-effects of grade > 1 , study proceeded to phase II ( n = 50 ) . After unblinding of results , eight men ( 4 per arm , 2 without and 2 with PCa , respectively ) were randomly selected and totRNA extracted from `` non-pathological tissues ., MicroRNA profiling was performed with the Agilent platform . Raw data processing used R-statistical language and linear models for microarray analysis . Samples were stable except for lycopene , showing significant degradation ( SC = 56 % , AC = 59 % ) and consequently stabilized under vacuum in a dark packaging . Mean plasmatic lycopene concentration was 1,450,4 M. At 6 months , 53 men underwent re-biopsy and 13 ( 24.5 % ) were diagnosed with PCa ( supplementation n = 10 , placebo n = 3  P = 0.053  ) . At a mean 37 months follow-up , 3 additional PCa were found in the placebo group . No significant variations in PSA , IPSS , and PR25 questionnaires were observed . Stronger modulation of miRNAs was present on re-biopsy in the supplementation group compared to the placebo , including : ( i ) overexpression of miRNAs present in PCa versus non-cancer tissue ; ( ii ) underexpression of miRNAs suppressing PCa proliferation ; ( iii ) detection of 35 miRNAs in PCa patients versus disease-free men , including androgen-regulated miR-125b-5p and PTEN-targeting miR-92a-3p ( both upregulated ) . Administration of high doses of lycopene , GTCs , and selenium in men harboring HGPIN and/or ASAP was associated with a higher incidence of PCa at re-biopsy and expression of microRNAs implicated in PCa progression at molecular analysis .

The study sample in this article consists only of women who had LSIL at enrollment . Within 6 months of an LSIL diagnosis ( based on a Pap smear read by a community-based cytopathologist ) , women who were 18 years of age or older completed a standardized questionnaire and underwent a pelvic examination that included collection of cervical specimens for HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture II ( HCII ) ( R ) assay . Among the 642 women referred with LSIL who had analyzable test results , the mean chronologic age and age at first coitus were similar among the four clinical centers , despite the centers ethnic and geographic diversity ., Overall , HPV DNA was detected in cervical samples from 532 ( 82.9 % ) of the 642 women ( 95 % confidence interval = 79.7 % -85.7 % ) . This high frequency of HPV positivity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assays in a subset of 210 paired specimens tested by HCII and PCR ( 81.4 % were positive by both methods ) . Because a very high percentage of women with an LSIL diagnosis from Pap smears are positive for HPV DNA by HCII testing , there is limited potential for this assay to direct decisions about the clinical management of women with LSIL . The role of HPV testing in the management of women with ASCUS is still under study . \" \n",

Sixty-nine patients ( limited disease , n = 30 ; extensive disease , n = 39 ) treated at 15 European centers were scheduled to receive three courses of high-dose chemotherapy with ifosfamide 10 g/m ( 2 ) , carboplatin 1200 mg/m ( 2 ) , and etoposide 1200 mg/m ( 2 ) ( ICE ) divided over 4 days at 28-day intervals . PBPCs were harvested before treatment and mobilized with epirubicin 150 mg/m ( 2 ) administered via an intravenous bolus divided over 2 days and filgrastim 5 microg/kg/d administered subcutaneously . The performed leukaphereses ( one to five per patient ) yielded a median of 16.6 x 10 ( 6 ) / kg ( range , 1.0 to 96.6 x 10 ( 6 ) / kg ) CD34 ( + ) cells , which was sufficient for three reinfusions . Fifty patients ( 72 % ) completed the treatment according to schedule . Nine patients completed two courses , and six patients completed one course of treatment . The increase in dose-intensity was 290 % that of a standard ICE regimen . The median duration of myelosuppression was similar between courses , namely 4 days ( range , 1 to 12 days ) for leukocytes less than 0.5 x 10 ( 9 ) / L and 4 days ( range , 0 to 22 days ) for thrombocytes less than 20 x 10 ( 9 ) / L. Febrile neutropenia developed in 66 % of courses , severe diarrhea in 14 % , mucositis in 10 % , and nausea and vomiting in 21 % of courses . There were six cases of toxic death ( 9 % ) , most of which occurred in the first year of accrual and thus were attributable to the learning curve . The antitumor effect of the regimen was reflected in an 86 % remission rate ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 74 % to 93 % ) , with 51 % of patients achieving a complete response ( 95 % CI , 38 % to 63 % ) . Median overall survival was 18 months for patients with limited disease and 11 months for patients with extensive disease . This multiple sequential high-dose ICE regimen could be safely administered on a multicenter basis to patients with small-cell lung cancer . The dose-intensity could be increased to 290 % that of standard ICE regimen . The benefit of this approach is currently being tested in a randomized trial that aims to double the long-term rate of survival for patients with small-cell lung cancer . \" \n",

To date , only a few studies have explored the relationship between CAD and PCa risk , with conflicting results . The four-year REDUCE study tested dutasteride 0.5 mg daily for PCa risk reduction in men with prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative biopsy . Among men who underwent at least one on-study biopsy ( n = 6,729 ; 82.8 % ) , the association between CAD and overall PCa risk and disease grade was examined with logistic and multinomial logistic regression adjusting for clinicopathologic features , respectively . Overall , 547 men ( 8.6 % ) had a history of CAD . Men with CAD were significantly older and had higher body mass index , PSA , and larger prostate volumes and were more likely to have diabetes , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia and take aspirin and statins . On multivariate analysis , CAD was associated with a 35 % increased risk of PCa diagnosis ( OR = 1.35 , 95 % CI : 1.08-1 .67 , P = 0.007 ) , while elevating risk of both low - ( OR = 1.34 , 95 % CI : 1.05-1 .73 , P = 0.02 ) and high-grade disease ( OR = 1.34 , 95 % CI : 0.95-1 .88 , P = 0.09 ) . In a post hoc hypothesis developing secondary analysis of the REDUCE study , CAD was significantly associated with increased PCa diagnosis . If confirmed in other studies , this suggests CAD may be a novel PCa risk factor and suggests common shared etiologies . Whether lifestyle changes shown to reduce CAD risk ( i.e. , weight loss , exercise , cholesterol reduction , etc. ) can reduce PCa risk , warrants further study . \" \n",

Patients were stratified on the basis of prior doxorubicin exposure , visceral disease , and institution . Cross-over to the opposite treatment arm was allowed with progressive or persistently stable disease . Twenty-three patients who had received a median of one prior chemotherapy regimen were assessable .

            " \"content\" : \" Cannabis based medicines are registered as a treatment for various indications , such as pain and spasms in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients , and anorexia and nausea in patients with HIV or receiving cancer treatment . the pharmacokinetics of the various administration routes of cannabis and cannabis based medicines are variable and dosing is hard to regulate . Namisol is a new tablet containing pure THC ( > 98 % ) that has a beneficial pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration . Namisol gives a quick onset of pharmacodynamic effects in healthy volunteers , which implies a rapid initiation of therapeutic effects in patients . Among the main disadvantages of currently available ( 9 ) - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) formulations are dosing difficulties due to poor pharmacokinetic characteristics . Namisol is a novel THC formulation , designed to improve THC absorption . The study objectives were to investigate the optimal administration route , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) and tolerability of Namisol . This first in human study consisted of two parts . Panel I included healthy males and females ( n = 6/6 ) in a double-blind , double-dummy , randomized , crossover study with sublingual ( crushed tablet ) and oral administration of Namisol ( 5 mg THC ) . Based on these results , male and female ( n = 4/5 ) participants from panel I received oral THC 6.5 and 8.0 mg or matching placebo in a randomized , crossover , rising dose study during panel II . PD measurements were body sway ; visual analogue scales ( VAS ) mood , psychedelic and heart rate . THC and 11-OH-THC population PK analysis was performed . Sublingual administration showed a flat concentration profile compared with oral administration . Oral THC apparent t ( 1/2 ) was 72-80 min , t ( max ) was 39-56 min and C ( max ) 2.92-4 .69 ng ml ( -1 ) . THC affected body sway ( 60.8 % , 95 % CI 29.5 , 99.8 ) , external perception ( 0.078 log mm , 95 % CI 0.019 , 0.137 ) , alertness ( -2.7 mm , 95 % CI -4.5 , -0.9 ) feeling high ( 0.256 log mm , 95 % CI 0.093 , 0.418 ) and heart rate ( 5.6 beats min ( -1 ) , 95 % CI 2.7 , 6.5 ) . Namisol was well tolerated . Oral Namisol showed promising PK and PD characteristics . Variability and t ( max ) of THC plasma concentrations were smaller for Namisol than reported for studies using oral dronabinol and nabilone . This study was performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers . Therefore , future research on Namisol should study clinical effects in patient populations . \" \n",

There was also a trend for improved overall survival in patients receiving matuzumab weekly versus every 3 weeks ( 12.4 months versus 5.9 months , respectively , versus 7.9 months for pemetrexed alone ) . The combination of pemetrexed and matuzumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile , with the most common grade 3/4 adverse event being neutropenia . Although the analysis on the pooled matuzumab-treated arms did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in objective response for the addition of matuzumab to pemetrexed compared with pemetrexed alone , the trends for improvement in objective response and overall survival for pemetrexed plus weekly matuzumab compared with pemetrexed alone warrant confirmation in additional clinical trials . \" \n",

Screening for prostate cancer is hotly debated , and evidence from trials about the effectiveness of treatments ( surgery , radiotherapy , and monitoring ) is lacking . Mounting a treatment trial is controversial because of past failures and concerns that differences in complications of treatment but not survival make randomisation unacceptable to patients and clinicians , particularly for a trial including monitoring . In-depth interviews explored interpretation of study information . Audiotape recordings of recruitment appointments enabled scrutiny of content and presentation of study information by recruiters . Initial qualitative findings showed that recruiters had difficulty discussing equipoise and presenting treatments equally ; they unknowingly used terminology that was misinterpreted by participants . Findings were used to determine changes to content and presentation of information . Changes to the order of presenting treatments encouraged emphasis on equivalence , misinterpreted terms were avoided , the non-radical arm was redefined , and randomisation and clinical equipoise were presented more convincingly . The randomisation rate increased from 40 % to 70 % , all treatments became acceptable , and the three arm trial became the preferred design . Changes to information and presentation resulted in efficient recruitment acceptable to patients and clinicians . Embedding this controversial trial within qualitative research improved recruitment .

TS expression was assessed using the immunohistochemical method with the monoclonal antibody TS 106 on paraffin-embedded tissue specimens . High TS expression was associated with a significantly worse prognosis in node-positive but not in node-negative breast cancer patients . Twenty-seven percent of node-positive patients with high TS expression were disease-free at 10 years , compared with 44 % of node-positive patients with low TS expression ( P = .03 ) . Forty-one percent of patients with node-positive high-TS-expressing tumors were alive after 10 years , compared with 49 % of those with low TS expression ( P = .06 ) . The association between TS and disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) was independent of other prognostic factors such as tumor size , tumor grade , nodal status , vessel invasion , estrogen receptor ( ER ) / progestin receptor ( PR ) status , c-erb B-2 , or Ki-67 expression . In node-positive patients , six cycles of standard adjuvant cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and fluorouracil (  5-FU  CMF ) CT improved DFS and OS compared with one cycle of perioperative CMF therapy . The magnitude of this benefit was greatest in patients whose tumors had high TS expression ( P < .01 for DFS ; P < .01 for OS ) . Node-negative patients demonstrated no difference in outcome to CT based on TS expression ; however , the power to detect differences was limited by the small number of events in this group . In early-stage breast cancer , high TS expression is associated with a significantly worse prognosis in node-positive patients . Node-positive patients with high TS levels demonstrate the most significant improvement in DFS and OS when treated with six cycles of conventional adjuvant CMF therapy . \" \n",

The trial was designed to detect a 55 % reduction in the local failure hazard rate with 80 % statistical power . Between April 1996 and July 2003 , a total of 250 patients were enrolled . Of 239 patients analyzable for outcomes , 94 % were male , 83 % had a Karnofsky performance status of 90-100 , and 62 % had T2a tumor . Median follow-up for all surviving patients was 7.9 years ( range , 0.6-13 .1 years ) . The 5-year local control ( LC ) rate was 8 points higher but not statistically significant ( P = .14 for HFX  78 %  vs SFX  70 %  ) , corresponding to a 30 % hazard rate reduction . The 5-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) was 49 % versus 40 % ( P = .13 ) and overall survival ( OS ) was 72 % versus 63 % ( P = .29 ) . HFX was associated with higher rates of acute skin , mucosal , and laryngeal toxicity .

            " \"content\" : \" Oral mucositis is a dose-limiting and painful side effect of radiotherapy ( RT ) and/or chemotherapy in cancer patients . The purpose of the present study was to analyze the effect of different protocols of laser phototherapy ( LPT ) on the grade of mucositis and degree of pain in patients under RT. . Thirty-nine patients were divided into three groups : G1 , where the irradiations were done three times a week using low power laser ; G2 , where combined high and low power lasers were used three time a week ; and G3 , where patients received low power laser irradiation once a week . The low power LPT was done using an InGaAlP laser ( 660 nm/40 mW/6 J cm ( -2 ) / 0.24 J per point ) . In the combined protocol , the high power LPT was done using a GaAlAs laser ( 808 nm , 1 W/cm ( 2 ) ) . Oral mucositis was assessed at each LPT session in accordance to the oral-mucositis scale of the National Institute of the Cancer-Common Toxicity criteria ( NIC-CTC ) . The patient self-assessed pain was measured by means of the visual analogue scale . All protocols of LPT led to the maintenance of oral mucositis scores in the same levels until the last RT session . Moreover , LPT three times a week also maintained the pain levels . However , the patients submitted to the once a week LPT had significant pain increase ; and the association of low/high LPT led to increased healing time . These findings are desired when dealing with oncologic patients under RT avoiding unplanned radiation treatment breaks and additional hospital costs . \" \n",

Acute toxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) . As for acute xerostomia , patients with laryngeal cancer were excluded from evaluation . 50 patients were evaluable ( 25 patients in the RC + CT , 25 patients in the RC + CT + A group ) . Clinical characteristics were well balanced in both treatment groups . Amifostine provided reduction in acute xerostomia and mucositis but had no obvious influence on Karnofsky performance status , body weight , cutaneous side effects , and alopecia . The differences between both groups were statistically significant for acute xerostomia and nonsignificant , but with a trend for mucositis . According to our results , there is a radioprotective effect on salivary glands and a potential effect on oral mucosa by amifostine in postoperative radiotherapy combined with carboplatin . To improve the radio - and chemoprotective effects of amifostine in clinical practice , the application of a higher dose ( > 250 mg ) seems to be necessary . \" \n",

Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) - positive breast cancer were further randomized to 9 weeks of trastuzumab or no trastuzumab . Seven hundred five of 1010 tumors had sufficient DNA for genotyping of 70 somatic hotspot mutations in 20 genes using mass spectrometry . Distant disease-free survival ( DDFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , and interactions with trastuzumab were explored with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses . All statistical tests were two-sided . Median follow-up was 62 months . Of 705 tumors , 687 were successfully genotyped . PIK3CA mutations ( exons 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 13 , 18 , and 20 ) were present in 25.3 % ( 174 of 687 ) and TP53 mutations in 10.2 % ( 70 of 687 ) . Few other mutations were found : three ERBB2 and single cases of KRAS , ALK , STK11/LKB1 , and AKT2 . PIK3CA mutations were associated with estrogen receptor positivity ( P < .001 ) and the luminal-A phenotype ( P = .04 ) but were not statistically significantly associated with prognosis ( DDFS : hazard ratio  HR  = 0.88 , 95 % confidence  CI  = 0.58 to 1.34 , P = .56 ; OS : HR = 0.603 , 95 % CI = .32 to 1.13 , P = .11 ) , although a statistically significant nonproportional prognostic effect was observed for DDFS ( P = .002 ) . PIK3CA mutations were not statistically significantly associated with trastuzumab benefit ( P ( interaction ) : DDFS P = .14 ; OS P = .24 ) . In this dataset , targeted genotyping revealed only two alterations at a frequency greater than 10 % , with other mutations observed infrequently .

The trial comprised two treatment arms , i.e. patients were randomized to orchidectomy alone or orchidectomy plus lycopene ( OL ) , each of 27 patients . Lycopene was started on the day of orchidectomy at 2 mg twice daily . Patients were evaluated clinically before and every 3 months after the intervention , with measurements of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , a bone scan and uroflowmetry , with the clinical response assessed as the change in these variables . At 6 months there was a significant reduction in PSA level in both treatments , but more marked in the OL group ( mean 9.1 and 26.4 ng/mL , P = 0.9 ) . After 2 years these changes were more consistent in the OL group ( mean 3.01 and 9.02 ng/mL ; P < 0.001 ) . Eleven ( 40 % ) patients in orchidectomy and 21 ( 78 % ) in the OL group had a complete PSA response ( P < 0.05 ) , with a partial response in nine ( 33 % ) and four ( 15 % ) , and progression in seven ( 25 % ) and two ( 7 % ) , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) .

Of the 71 evaluable patients assigned to receive warfarin , 15 ( 21.1 % ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 12.3 % -32.4 % ) experienced one major outcome event compared with 7 ( 10.5 % ) of the 67 evaluable patients assigned to receive enoxaparin ( 95 % CI , 4.3 % -20.3 % ; P = .09 ) . There were 6 deaths owing to hemorrhage in the warfarin group compared with none in the enoxaparin group . In the warfarin group , 17 patients ( 22.7 % ) died ( 95 % CI , 13.8 % -33.8 % ) compared with 8 ( 11.3 % ) in the enoxaparin group ( 95 % CI , 5.0 % -21.0 % ; P = .07 ) . No difference was observed regarding the progression of the underlying cancer or cancer-related death . These results confirm that warfarin is associated with a high bleeding rate in patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer . Prolonged treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin may be as effective as oral anticoagulants and may be safer in these cancer patients . \" \n",

Previous studies have suggested that relatives should be involved in psychosocial rehabilitation to address the needs for an interpersonal relationship with others in the disease trajectory . We developed an innovative rehabilitation program to be offered to the patient and a relative as a pair . The aim of the present pilot study was to examine the feasibility of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) and to evaluate the impact on quality of life . The study was designed as an RCT comparing the new multimodal psychosocial rehabilitation with the usual services . The intervention comprised three ` supportive talks and a residential rehabilitation course ., From March 2010 to March 2011 , participation was offered at the time of diagnosis to patients with lung or gynecological cancer from two departments at Odense University Hospital in Denmark . Questionnaires were used to estimate changes in quality of life ( EORTC-QLQ-C30 on global health status ) and well-being ( WHO-Five Well-Being Index ) at baseline and after 2 and 12 months . Information on the participants views about the rehabilitation intervention was obtained from assessment charts and qualitative interviews ., A total of 209 patients were assessed for eligibility , but only 42 pairs were randomized to the study . The 2-month follow-up was completed by 34 patients and 32 relatives , and 19 patients and 21 relatives completed the 12-month follow-up . A higher dropout rate at the 12-month follow-up was reported in the intervention group compared with controls . Quality of life and well-being increased for patients and relatives in both the intervention and the control group , and no clinically significant difference was observed between the intervention and the control group . Pairs reported that the time of inclusion was inconvenient and that rehabilitation ought to meet their changing needs . The pilot study showed that it may be difficult to conduct an RCT of a psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for pairs , and difficulties with inclusion and drop out have to be addressed . Interventions need to be carefully developed and tested before evaluating an effect in a large-scale study . \" \n",

We assessed whether the increased high-grade prostate cancer associated with finasteride in the PCPT was due to finasteride s potential effects on tumor morphology or prostate size ., Prostate biopsies with Gleason score 8-10 ( n = 90 , finasteride ; n = 52 , placebo ) were examined histologically for hormonal effects , and those with Gleason score 7-10 ( n = 282 , finasteride ; n = 244 , placebo ) were examined for pathologic surrogates of disease extent . Prostate volumes were measured at biopsy . Samples from radical prostatectomies ( n = 222 , finasteride ; n = 306 , placebo ) were examined for tumor grade and extent , and , where possible , grades at biopsy and prostatectomy were compared between the groups . Logistic regression was used to analyze differences between treatment groups with respect to pathologic criteria . All statistical tests were two-sided . Degenerative hormonal changes in high-grade biopsies were equivalent between the finasteride and placebo groups , but prostate volumes were lower in the finasteride group ( median = 25.1 versus 34.4 cm3 , P < .001 ) . Pathologic surrogates for tumor extent were lower with finasteride than with placebo , including mean percentage of positive cores ( 34 % versus 38 % , P = .016 ) , mean tumor linear extent ( greatest  4.4 versus 4.8 mm , P = .19  and aggregate  7.6 versus 9.2 mm , P = .13  ) , bilaterality ( 22.8 % versus 30.6 % , P = .046 ) , and perineural invasion ( 14.2 % versus 20.3 % , P = .07 ) . Among patients who had prostatectomy , the finasteride-associated increase in high-grade disease ( Gleason score > or = 7 ) at biopsy ( 42.7 % finasteride versus 25.4 % placebo , P < .001 ) was diminished at prostatectomy ( 46.4 % finasteride versus 38.6 % placebo , P = .10 ) . Biopsy identified a greater proportion of patients with high-grade disease present at prostatectomy in the finasteride group than in the placebo group ( 69.7 % versus 50.5 % , P = .01 ) . The rate of upgrading ( from low-grade cancer at biopsy to high-grade cancer at prostatectomy ) and pathologic stage at prostatectomy were similar in both groups . Effects of finasteride on prostate volume and selective inhibition of low-grade cancer , rather than effects on tumor morphology , may have contributed to the increase in high-grade cancers with finasteride in the PCPT . Although induction of high-grade cancer can not be excluded , the results suggest that high-grade cancer was detected earlier and was less extensive in the finasteride group than in the placebo group . \" \n",

Patients in the screening group were invited to undergo initial PSA testing between 1995 and 1996 and then were invited to receive testing every second year thereafter for 8 years ( for a total of 4 PSA tests ) . Men with PSA levels > or = 3 ng/mL ( or > or = 2.54 ng/mL , in the third and fourth screening rounds ) were invited to undergo clinical investigation , which included sextant biopsy of the prostate . By linking to the regional cancer registry , the authors were able to obtain the true and expected incidence rates for the screening and control groups . The screening participation rate was high ( 73 % ) . A total of 884 malignancies have been detected to date , with 640 having been detected in the screening group . There was an early and marked shift toward more favorable disease stage and grade for malignancies detected on repeat screening . In the fourth screening round , only 2 of 82 detected malignancies were classified as advanced disease . Of the 227 screen-detected tumors on which surgery was performed , only 20 ( 8.8 % ) had small volume ( < 0.2 cm3 ) . Forty-three interval malignancies were detected , but only five were accompanied by symptoms . At 8 years , the cumulative disease incidence rate among screening participants was 7.3 % , compared with 2.4 % in the control arm . The incidence rate observed in the screening population corresponds to the cumulative incidence rate observed in the Swedish male population at age 72 years . Biennial PSA screening was very successful in diagnosing prostate carcinoma at an early stage , when curative treatment typically is effective . In addition , the results regarding interval malignancies were favorable . Thus , decreased mortality should be observed on long-term follow-up . The lead time associated with screening appears to fall within the range described in earlier studies involving frozen sera ( i.e. , 5-9 years ) . \" \n",

This study was designed to evaluate the role of oral ketamine or transdermal nitroglycerin polymer , a nitric oxide donor , as coadjuvants to oral morphine in cancer pain therapy . After institutional approval and informed patient consent were obtained , 60 patients with cancer pain were randomized to one of four groups ( n = 15 ) and studied prospectively to evaluate analgesia and any adverse effects . A visual analog scale that consisted of a 10-cm line with 0 representing `` no pain at all and 10 representing `` the worst possible pain was introduced ., All patients were regularly taking oral amitriptyline 50 mg at bedtime . The morphine regimen was adjusted individually to a maximal oral dose of 80-90 mg/day to keep the visual analog scale score less than 4 . When patients reported pain ( visual analog scale of 4 or more ) , despite taking 80-90 mg oral morphine daily , the test drug was added as follows : the control group ( CG ) received an additional 20 mg oral morphine ( 10 mg at 12-h intervals ) ; the nitroglycerin group ( NG ) received a 5-mg nitroglycerin patch daily ; the ketamine group ( KG ) received 0.5 mg/kg oral ketamine at 12-h intervals ; and the dipyrone group ( DG ) received 500 mg oral dipyrone at 6-h intervals . Patients were free to manipulate their daily morphine consumption when the test drug was introduced to keep their visual analog scale score less than 4 . The groups were similar with respect to demographic data and visual analog scale pain scores before treatment . The visual analog scale scores after the test drug was introduced were similar among the groups . The daily consumption of oral morphine was as follows : on day 15 : CG = DG = NG ( P > 0.05 ) , CG > KG ( P = 0.036 ) ; on day 20 : CG > NG = KG ( P < 0.02 ) ( CG > KG , P < 0.005 ; CG > NG , P < 0.02 ) , DG > KG ( P < 0.05 ) ; on day 30 : CG = DG > KG = NG ( P < 0.05 ) .

Subsequently , product labeling was revised including addition of a black-box warning and removal of many quality of life claims not supported by current standards , and there were changes in reimbursement and anaemia guidelines . The extent to which these events influenced ESA dosing and Hb levels in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis ( CKD-NOD ) is not known . We used data collected in a series of cross-sectional surveys between March 2005 and July 2009 . Patients with CKD-NOD were selected from a random sample of free-standing US nephrology clinics . Information on demographics , insurance information , laboratory data and ESA use was abstracted from medical records by site investigators . We evaluated ESA treatment ( use and dosing ) and Hb levels over time and used multivariate linear regression to assess changes in ESA doses and Hb levels over time adjusting for case-mix differences . Between 2005 and 2009 , 15 836 CKD-NOD patients were sampled . During this period , ESA use declined from 60 to 46 % , and the mean dose declined from 176 to 136 mcg/month ; the largest decline in use and in dose occurred beginning in 2007 . Simultaneously , the mean ( standard deviation ) Hb level in ESA-treated patients declined from 11.5 ( 1.4 ) to 10.6 ( 1.2 ) g/dL , though the decline was most pronounced starting in 2007 . As the mean Hb declined , the percent of treated patients with an Hb > 12 g/dL dropped from 27 to 12 % , and the mean dose in this sub-population declined from 173 to 111 mcg/month . The emergence of safety concerns and the subsequent changes in product labeling , reimbursement and clinical practice guidelines all appear to have influenced physician dosing practices resulting in less frequent use of ESAs , lower ESA doses and lower achieved Hb levels in CKD-NOD patients . \" \n",

Higher exercise adherence was achieved by HNC participants who had undergone nerve sparing neck dissection procedures and who were not regular drinkers . Excellent adherence to exercise was achieved in the trial despite high morbidity associated with HNC treatment . The high adherence achieved was likely due to the select and highly motivated sample of HNC survivors as well as to factors associated with trial design such as the support offered to participants .

No significant difference was observed in relapse-free survival  hazard ratio 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.74-1 .52 , p = 0.76  or overall survival  hazard ratio 1.18 , 95 % CI 0.80-1 .75 , p = 0.40  . Five patients died from treatment related causes , three as a consequence of HDT and two in the conventional FEC arm . At the present time , no benefit has been observed from replacing three cycles of conventional chemotherapy with the HDT regimen described here . Patients should continue to receive conventional chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer . \" \n",

We evaluated the effects of an educational video on patients distress , cancer knowledge , coping skills and attitudes regarding learning about cancer at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis ., An educational video was developed in which oncology professionals , women with ovarian cancer , and their relatives discussed cancer information and experiences . Women admitted for initial diagnostic surgical staging for ovarian cancer were randomized to the educational or placebo video . Before and after the video , patients completed measures of ( 1 ) ovarian cancer information , ( 2 ) emotional distress , ( 3 ) learning attitudes , and ( 4 ) coping self-efficacy . Outcomes were analyzed for differences in mean change between intervention and placebo groups using t-tests . Fifty-nine subjects were randomized ( 30 intervention/29 placebo ) . The majority were advanced staged , white , insured , high school educated , employed , and rated their disease seriousness as high . Anxiety , general distress and cancer-specific distress were high . Pre-post video : distress and self-efficacy between groups were unchanged , intervention subjects answered more knowledge items correctly ( p = 0.0004 ) and developed more negative learning attitudes ( p = 0.037 ) . Following the educational video , patients who developed more negative attitudes also had increased intrusive thinking ( p = 0.046 ) , a sign of increased distress .

The early PSA test-based variables evaluated were the pretreatment initial PSA ( iPSA ) value , PSA values at 2 and 4 months into NADT , the PSA nadir ( nPSA ) value after radiation in all patients , and PSA response signatures in men receiving radiation . Comparisons of endpoints were made using Cox models of local progression-free survival , distant failure-free survival , biochemical failure-free survival , and prostate cancer-specific survival . The nPSA value was a powerful predictor of all endpoints regardless of whether NADT was given before radiation . PSA response signatures also predicted all endpoints in men treated by radiation alone . iPSA and PSA results at 2 and 4 months into NADT predicted biochemical failure-free survival but not any of the clinical endpoints . nPSA values correlated with those of iPSA , Gleason grade , and T stage and were significantly higher in men receiving radiation alone than in those receiving NADT . The postradiation nPSA value is the strongest prognostic indicator of all early PSA-based variables . However , its use as a surrogate endpoint needs to take into account its dependence on pretreatment variables and treatment method . \" \n",

The first group ( group A , n = 26 ) received 1 mg of DES with 75 mg of aspirin per day in addition to the primary hormonal treatment . The second group ( group B , n = 32 ) received bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg/day in addition to the primary treatment . Patients were followed up every 3 months with their PSA being checked and were also monitored for any clinical progression and adverse effects as a result of treatment . Any adverse event occurring after patients were started on treatment was attributed to the drug and patients were clinically assessed at each visit . Failure of treatment was defined as a 50 % or greater increase in PSA after commencing treatment . Once randomized , all patients were followed up for survival regardless of failure of second-line hormonal manipulation . The mean age of the patients was 76.7 years ( 60-88 , SD 7.4 ) in group A and 76 years ( 67-86 , SD 6.9 ) in group B. Twelve patients in each group had metastatic disease . The median follow-up periods for both groups were 24 months ( range 6-48 in group A , range 3-54 in group B ) . 65 % of the patients in group A ( 17/26 ) and 43.5 % ( 14/32 ) in group B had a fall in their PSA levels ( p = 0.08 , Fisher s exact test ) with 23 % ( 6/26 ) and 31 % ( 10/32 ) having a > 50 % response respectively ( p = 0.34 , Fisher s exact test ) ., Mean PSA nadir in those who responded were 20.6 ng/ml ( range 1.6-59 .4 ) and 7.41 ng/ml ( range 0.1-42 .6 ) in groups A and B respectively . The median duration of response was 9 months ( 3-18 months ) for group A and 12 months ( 3-18 months ) for group B. Seven patients in group A and 6 in group B experienced adverse events . Three of the 7 in the group A experienced cardiovascular related adverse effects ( 1 congestive cardiac failure , 1 pulmonary embolism and 1 stroke ) . At the end of the study period , 14 ( 54 % ) of group A patients were alive and 12 ( 46 % ) were dead . In group B , 15 ( 47 % ) were alive , 16 ( 50 % ) were dead and 1 ( 3 % ) lost to follow-up . At the completion of the study , 3 patients in each group were still on treatment . Low-dose DES and 50 mg of bicalutamide per day are equally effective in hormone refractory prostate carcinoma with respect to biochemical response , although DES has more severe adverse effects .

Recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) of data from three Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) trials ( 1200 patients ) has allowed three prognostic groups to be identified . More recently a simplified stratification system that uses the evaluation of three main prognostics factors for radiosurgery in BM was developed . To analyze the overall survival rate ( OS ) , prognostic factors affecting outcomes and to estimate the potential improvement in OS for patients with BM from breast cancer , stratified by RPA class and brain metastases score ( BS-BM ) . From January 1996 to December 2004 , 174 medical records of patients with diagnosis of BM from breast cancer , who received WBRT were analyzed . The surgery followed by WBRT was used in 15.5 % of patients and 84.5 % of others patients were submitted at WBRT alone ; 108 patients ( 62.1 % ) received the fractionation schedule of 30 Gy in 10 fractions . Solitary BM was present in 37.9 % of patients . The prognostic factors evaluated for OS were : age , Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) , number of lesions , localization of lesions , neurosurgery , chemotherapy , absence extracranial disease , RPA class , BS-BM and radiation doses and fractionation . The OS in 1 , 2 and 3 years was 33.4 % , 16.7 % , and 8.8 % , respectively . The RPA class analysis showed strong relation with OS ( p < 0.0001 ) . The median survival time by RPA class in months was : class I 11.7 , class II 6.2 and class III 3.0 . The significant prognostic factors associated with better OS were : higher KPS ( p < 0.0001 ) , neurosurgery ( P < 0.0001 ) , single metastases ( p = 0.003 ) , BS-BM ( p < 0.0001 ) , control primary tumor ( p = 0.002 ) and absence of extracranial metastases ( p = 0.001 ) . In multivariate analysis , the factors associated positively with OS were : neurosurgery ( p < 0.0001 ) , absence of extracranial metastases ( p < 0.0001 ) and RPA class I ( p < 0.0001 ) . Our data suggests that patients with BM from breast cancer classified as RPA class I may be effectively treated with local resection followed by WBRT , mainly in those patients with single BM , higher KPS and cranial extra disease controlled . RPA class was shown to be the most reliable indicators of survival . \" \n",

We compared rates of endometrial and other cancers in tamoxifen - and non-tamoxifen-treated patients and described the pathologic characteristics of the endometrial cancers . Data were analyzed on 2843 patients with node-negative , estrogen receptor-positive , invasive breast cancer randomly assigned to placebo or tamoxifen ( 20 mg/d ) and on 1220 tamoxifen-treated patients registered in NSABP B-14 subsequent to randomization . Average time on study is 8 years for randomly assigned patients and 5 years for registered patients . The incidence rates of liver , gastrointestinal , urinary tract , and nonuterine genital tumors were not increased by tamoxifen treatment . Twenty-five endometrial cancers were originally reported , one of which was reclassified after subsequent review . Two cases occurred in the placebo group in patients whose medical status subsequent to random assignment had required tamoxifen treatment . Twenty-three occurred in the tamoxifen groups . Twenty-one of the 24 originally reported endometrial cancers were FIGO stage 1 ; 18 of 23 gradable cases were of good to moderate histologic grade . Four tamoxifen-treated women died of uterine cancer . The average annual hazard rate of endometrial cancer as a first event within the first 5 years of follow-up in the randomized , tamoxifen-treated group was 1.2 / 1000 patient-years ; the cumulative hazard rate was 6.3 / 1000 . Findings for the registered , tamoxifen-treated group were similar . Including all originally reported endometrial cancers , the annual hazard rate through all follow-up was 0.2 / 1000 in the placebo group and 1.6 / 1000 in the randomized , tamoxifen-treated group ; the relative risk of endometrial cancer for the latter versus the former group was 7.5 . Again for the latter group , using population-based rates of endometrial cancer from SEER data and information from another NSABP ( B-06 ) trial , relative risks were 2.2 and 2.3 , respectively . The 5-year cumulative hazard rate for disease-free survival in the randomized tamoxifen group was 38 % less than that in the placebo group . Some data in this paper were provided by an investigator who submitted fraudulent data to the NSABP  see the `` News section  ; therefore , the reader must read the entire text including Table 10 and the Editor s notes ., In brief , data on 182 of the 2843 randomly assigned patients and 37 of the 1220 registered patients were provided by the investigator in question . After review , 24 of the 182 records showed falsification , all involving characteristics of patients prior to random assignment . Of the 37 registered-patient records , 8 showed falsification . Risk of endometrial cancer increases following tamoxifen therapy for invasive breast cancer ; however , net benefit greatly outweighs risk . Endometrial cancers occurring after tamoxifen therapy do not appear to be of a different type with a worse prognosis than are such tumors in non-tamoxifen-treated patients . Tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer should continue . In addition , the relative risk of endometrial cancer observed in B-14 tamoxifen-treated patients is consistent with the twofold relative risk used in the initial risk-benefit computation for the NSABP breast cancer prevention trial . \" \n",

However , whether the addition of chemotherapy improves outcome without adding to morbidity is not known . Our trial was designed to compare combined modality therapy ( CMT ) with radiotherapy alone in patients with epidermoid anal cancer . From 856 patients considered for entry to our multicentre trial , 585 patients were randomised to receive initially either 45 Gy radiotherapy in twenty or twenty-five fractions over 4-5 weeks ( 290 patients ) or the same regimen of radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil ( 1000 mg/m2 for 4 days or 750 mg/m2 for 5 days ) by continuous infusion during the first and the final weeks of radiotherapy and mitomycin ( 12 mg/m2 ) on day 1 of the first course ( 295 patients ) . We assessed clinical response 6 weeks after initial treatment : good responders were recommended for boost radiotherapy and poor responders for salvage surgery . The main endpoint was local-failure rate ( > or = 6 weeks after initial treatment ) ; secondary endpoints were overall and cause-specific survival . Analysis was by intention-to-treat . In the radiotherapy and CMT arms , respectively , five and three were ineligible , and six and nine died 6 weeks after initial treatment . After a median follow-up of 42 months ( interquartile range 28-62 ) , 164 of 279 ( 59 % ) radiotherapy patients had a local failure compared with 101 of 283 ( 36 % ) CMT patients . This gave a 46 % reduction in the risk of local failure in the patients receiving CMT ( relative risk 0.54 , 95 % CI 0.42-0 .69 , p < 0.0001 ) . The risk of death from anal cancer was also reduced in the CMT arm ( 0.71 , 0.53-0 .95 , p = 0.02 ) . There was no overall survival advantage ( 0.86 , 0.67-1 .11 , p = 0.25 ) . Early morbidity was significantly more frequent in the CMT arm ( p = 0.03 ) , but late morbidity occurred at similar rates . Our trial shows that the standard treatment for most patients with epidermoid anal cancer should be a combination of radiotherapy and infused 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin , with surgery reserved for those who fall on this regimen . \" \n",

Tamoxifen is safe and effective in preventing breast events induced by bicalutamide monotherapy without affecting antitumor activity , but possible interference between bicalutamide and tamoxifen remains a matter of concern . To reduce the exposure to tamoxifen , we considered the putative advantages of weekly administration . To compare the efficacy of two different schedules of tamoxifen in preventing breast events . Toxicity , prostate-specific antigen behaviour , and sexual-functioning scores were also evaluated . This was a noninferiority trial . From December 2003 to February 2006 , 80 patients with localised/locally advanced or biochemically recurrent PCa who were also candidates for bicalutamide single therapy were randomised to receive two different schedules of tamoxifen : daily ( n = 41 ) and weekly ( n = 39 ) . Median follow-up was 24.2 mo. . Daily bicalutamide ( 150 mg ) plus daily tamoxifen 20mg continuously ( daily group ) or the same but with tamoxifen at 20mg weekly after the first 8 wk of daily treatment ( weekly group ) . Three patients in the weekly group and one in the daily group were discontinued for adverse events . For gynaecomastia , we used ultrasonography . For mastalgia and sexual functioning , we used questionnaires . Gynaecomastia developed in 31.7 % of patients in the daily group and in 74.4 % of patients in the weekly group ( p < 0.0001 ) , and it was more severe in patients who switched to weekly tamoxifen ( p = 0.001 ) . Mastalgia occurred in 12.2 % and 46.1 % of patients , respectively ( p = 0.001 ) . There were no major differences among treatment schedules relative to sexual functioning scores and incidence and severity of adverse events . No differences between groups in PSA behaviour and disease progression have been detected so far . This study demonstrated that tamoxifen 20mg/wk is inferior to tamoxifen 20mg/d in preventing the incidence and severity of bicalutamide-induced breast events . The safety and efficacy of tamoxifen at the common daily dose of 20mg for the prophylaxis of bicalutamide-induced breast events were confirmed . \" \n",

Our study aims are to test the hypotheses that using the SIPP ( a ) may contribute to adequate referral to relevant psychosocial caregivers , ( b ) should facilitate communication between radiotherapists and cancer patients about psychosocial distress and ( c ) may prevent underdiagnosis of early symptoms reflecting psychosocial problems . This paper presents the design of a cluster randomised controlled trial ( CRCT ) evaluating the effectiveness of using the SIPP in cancer patients treated with radiotherapy . A CRCT is developed using a Solomon four-group design ( two intervention and two control groups ) to evaluate the effects of using the SIPP . Radiotherapists , instead of cancer patients , are randomly allocated to the experimental or control groups . Within these groups , all included cancer patients are randomised into two subgroups : with and without pre-measurement . Self-reported assessments are conducted at four times : a pre-test at baseline before the first consultation and a post-test directly following the first consultation , and three and 12 months after baseline measurement . The primary outcome measures are the number and types of referrals of cancer patients with psychosocial problems to relevant ( psychosocial ) caregivers . The secondary outcome measures are patients satisfaction with the radiotherapist-patient communication , psychosocial distress and quality of life ., Furthermore , a process evaluation will be carried out .

            " \"content\" : \" Limited data are available on the efficacy of oral bisphosphonate therapy in breast cancer survivors . Our goal was to examine prevention of breast cancer-related bone loss in this cohort . Eighty-seven postmenopausal women after chemotherapy for breast cancer were randomly assigned to once-weekly risedronate 35 mg or placebo for 24 months . Outcomes included bone mineral density ( BMD ) and turnover markers . At study initiation , 13 % of patients were on an aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) . After 24 months , there were differences of 1.6 to 2.5 % ( P < .05 ) at the spine and hip BMD between the placebo and risedronate groups . At study completion , 44 % were on an AI . Adjusting for an AI , women on placebo plus AI had a decrease in BMD of ( mean + / - SE ) 4.8 % + / - 0.8 % at the spine and 2.8 % + / - 0.5 % at the total hip ( both P < .001 ) . In women on risedronate + AI , the spine decreased by 2.4 % + / - 1.1 % ( P < .05 ) and was stable at the hip . Women in the placebo group not on an AI , maintained BMD at the spine , and had a 1.2 % + / - 0.5 % loss at the total hip ( P < .05 ) . Women who received risedronate but no AI had the greatest improvement in BMD of 2.2 % + / - 0.9 % ( P < .05 ) at the total hip . Bone turnover was reduced with risedronate . There were no differences in adverse events between the groups . We conclude that in postmenopausal women with breast cancer with or without AI therapy , once-weekly oral risedronate was beneficial for spine and hip BMD , reduced bone turnover , and was well tolerated . \" \n",

Patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC previously treated with one to two systemic regimens , including a platinum doublet , were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive erlotinib 150 mg daily plus oral tivantinib 360 mg twice daily ( E + T ) or erlotinib plus placebo ( E + P ) until disease progression . Tumor specimens were evaluated for EGFR and KRAS mutations , MET expression , and MET gene amplification . The primary end point was overall survival ( OS ) . Secondary and exploratory objectives included progression-free survival ( PFS ) , OS in molecular subgroups , and safety . The study enrolled 1,048 patients and was discontinued for futility at the interim analysis . OS did not improve with E + T versus E + P ( median OS , 8.5 v 7.8 months , respectively ; hazard ratio  HR  , 0.98 ; 95 % CI , 0.84 to 1.15 ; P = .81 ) , even though PFS increased ( median PFS , 3.6 v 1.9 months ; HR , 0.74 ; 95 % CI , 0.62 to 0.89 ; P < .001 ) . Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested OS improvement in patients with high MET expression ( HR , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.49 to 1.01 ) . Most common adverse events occurring with E + T versus E + P were rash ( 33.1 % v 37.3 % , respectively ) , diarrhea ( 34.6 % v 41.0 % ) , asthenia or fatigue ( 43.5 % v 38.1 % ) , and neutropenia ( grade 3 to 4 ; 8.5 % v 0.8 % ) . E + T was well tolerated and increased PFS but did not improve OS in the overall nonsquamous NSCLC population . \" \n",

Although adiposity and sex hormones have been studied in the past , previous reports in postmenopausal women have not been conducted under carefully controlled dietary conditions . In this study , we investigated the usefulness of body mass index ( BMI ) as a sufficient adiposity measurement to assess associations with sex hormone levels . This study was conducted as a cross-sectional analysis within the control segment ( 0 g alcohol group ) of a randomized , crossover design , in which 51 postmenopausal women consumed 0 ( control ) , 15 ( one drink ) , and 30 ( two drinks ) g alcohol ( ethanol ) / d for 8 weeks each as part of a controlled diet . Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were administered to the women during the control ( 0 g alcohol ) segment , and a blood sample was drawn at the end of that diet period for hormone analysis . In multivariate analysis ( adjusted for age , race , family history of breast cancer , parity , and menarche < 12 years ) , women who were overweight or obese had significantly higher serum concentrations of estradiol , bioavailable estradiol , estrone , and estrone sulfate and lower sex hormone-binding globulin than normal weight women ( all P < 0.05 ) . In models adjusted for BMI and the covariates above , none of the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry adiposity measures added further information ( all P > 0.10 ) for these five analytes beyond that of BMI alone . In this population of postmenopausal women , under carefully controlled dietary conditions , we confirmed previous findings that higher levels of adiposity were associated with higher concentrations of estrogens and lower sex hormone-binding globulin , and we found that the use of the epidemiology-friendly BMI seems sufficient to assess associations with these hormone levels . \" \n",

English as a second language ( ESL ) classes provide ready access for individuals with limited English proficiency who are not reached by English language health education materials and media campaigns . We conducted a group-randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a hepatitis B ESL educational curriculum for Chinese immigrants . Five community-based organizations that provide ESL education in the greater Vancouver area participated in the study . Forty-one ESL classes ( which included 325 Chinese students ) were randomly assigned to experimental or control status . A follow-up survey , conducted six months after randomization , assessed knowledge about hepatitis B. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the data . Follow-up surveys were completed by 298 ( 92 % ) of the students . At follow-up , experimental group students were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) more likely than control group students to know that immigrants have higher hepatitis B infection rates than people who were born in Canada ; hepatitis B can be spread during childbirth , during sexual intercourse and by sharing razors ; hepatitis B is not spread by sharing eating utensils ; and hepatitis B infection can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer . Our findings indicate that ESL curricula can have a positive impact on health knowledge among Chinese immigrants with limited English . Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of ESL curricula for other immigrant groups , as well as other health topics . \" \n",

There is still controversy about the best technique for construction of the neobladder , and especially whether it is necessary to include an antireflux mechanism . We designed a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing two forms of ileal neobladder : the Studer pouch and the T-pouch . The latter includes an extraserosal tunneled afferent limb which prevents reflux from the pouch to the kidneys . The primary endpoint of the study is renal function and anatomy at 3 years following surgery , with secondary endpoints including early and late postoperative complications , renal infections and need for secondary procedures . To date we have randomized 462 patients over approximately 6 years , with a planned full enrollment of 550 patients . Ten percent of patients have been withdrawn because they did not undergo the planned orthotopic diversion due to a positive urethral margin on frozen section . We expect approximately 70 % of patients to be alive and available for follow-up at 3 years , which will give us ample power to detect clinically meaningful differences in the outcome of these two diversions . This trial has been feasible and randomization has been acceptable to most patients . Long-term follow-up of the patients on this trial should be able to definitively answer the question of the importance of an antireflux mechanism in the orthotopic neobladders construction . \" \n",

From an eligible cohort of 16700 women in a managed care organization , we randomly selected 2524 women at high , elevated , and average risk of ovarian cancer and administered a questionnaire to test our model ( response rate 76.3 % ) . Path analysis delineated the relationships between personal and cognitive characteristics ( number of relatives with cancer , age , ideas about cancer causation , perceived resemblance to an affected friend or relative , and ovarian cancer knowledge ) and emotional constructs ( closeness to an affected relative or friend , time spent processing the cancer experience , and cancer worry ) on perceived risk of ovarian cancer . Our final model fit the data well ( root mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ) = 0.028 , comparative fit index ( CFI ) = 0.99 , normed fit index ( NFI ) = 0.98 ) . This final model ( 1 ) demonstrated the nature and direction of relationships between cognitive characteristics and perceived risk ; ( 2 ) showed that time spent processing the cancer experience was associated with cancer worry ; and ( 3 ) showed that cancer worry moderately influenced perceived risk . Our results highlight the important role that family cancer experience has on cancer worry and shows how cancer experience translates into personal risk perceptions .

The aim of this study was to assess the need to introduce preoperative nutritional support in patients without malnutrition at qualification for surgery . This was a prospective , two-arm , randomized , controlled , open-label study . Patients in interventional group received nutritional supplementation for 14 days before surgery , while control group kept on to their everyday diet . Each patient s nutritional status was assessed twice -- at qualification ( weight loss in 6 months , laboratory parameters : albumin , total protein , transferrin , and total lymphocyte count ) and 1 day before surgery ( change in body weight and laboratory parameters ) ., After surgery , all patients were followed up for 30 days for postoperative complications . Fifty-four patients in interventional and 48 in control group were analyzed . In postoperative period , patients in control group suffered from significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) number of serious complications compared with patients receiving nutritional supplementation . Moreover , levels of all laboratory parameters declined significantly ( p < 0.001 ) in these patients , while in interventional arm were stable ( albumin and total protein ) or raised ( transferrin and total lymphocyte count ) . Preoperative nutritional support should be introduced for nonmalnourished patients as it helps to maintain proper nutritional status and reduce number and severity of postoperative complications compared with patients without such support . \" \n",

It is important to develop strategies to strengthen coping resources among these women . Research in art therapy has shown outcomes such as an increase in self-esteem and cohesion , significant improvement in global health , and a decrease in anxiety and depression . The aim of the present article was to describe the effects of an art therapy intervention program on coping resources in women with primary breast cancer . In this article , we report some of the results from a study including 41 women , aged 37-69 years old , with nonmetastatic primary breast cancer , referred to the Department of Oncology at Ume University Hospital in Sweden for postoperative radiotherapy . The women represented various socioeconomic backgrounds . They were randomized to a study group ( n = 20 ) with individual art therapy for 1 h/week during postoperative radiotherapy or to a control group ( n = 21 ) . The article focuses on changes in coping resources , as measured by the Coping Resources Inventory ( CRI ) before and 2 and 6 months after the start of radiotherapy . The study protocol was approved by the Ume University Ethical Committee at the Medical Faculty ( archive number 99-386 ) . There was an overall increase in coping resources among women with breast cancer after taking part in the art therapy intervention . Significant differences were seen between the study and control groups in the social domain on the second and third occasions . Significant differences were also observed in the total score on the second occasion . This study shows that individual art therapy provided by a trained art therapist in a clinical setting can give beneficial support to women with primary breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy , as it can improve their coping resources . \" \n",

Patients suffering from metastatic PC are faced with serious decisions regarding treatment strategies . Therefore , QOL information has become a crucial element of decision making in this group of patients . The first objective of this study was to describe QOL in a group of patients diagnosed with metastatic PC and skeletal metastases . At the time of evaluation the patients had not received any treatment but were evaluated before entering a study of androgen-modulating therapy ( the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group study 5 ) . The second objective was to identify demographic and disease-related factors affecting QOL . A total of 917 patients with metastatic PC were evaluated using a well-described and validated questionnaire  European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-C30 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 )  . The characteristics of the PC were noted , and simultaneously patients were evaluated with respect to use of analgesics , pain and performance status using a scoring system . Biochemical tests were performed when patients entered the study . A multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyse the correlations between QOL scores , patient demographics and disease-related data . The patients reported QOL scores significantly lower than those in the background population . Pain and fatigue were pronounced , whereas dyspnoea , insomnia , loss of appetite , constipation and diarrhoea were less prominent . Patients with high tumour grades , high PSPA scores ( the sum of the pain score , the performance status and the use of analgesics ) and those using analgesics had significantly lower QOL scores than the other patients . Patients with metastatic PC have reduced QOL . Our findings are in line with those of other studies of QOL among patients with this disease as evaluated by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire . Baseline data from studies like this provide important information when treatment modalities for PC are evaluated . \" \n",

Twelve work sites were randomly assigned to an intervention or nonintervention comparison condition . Intervention sites received access to a computer-tailored DA at the workplace . Male employees age 45 years and above ( n = 625 ) completed surveys at baseline and at 3-month follow-up , documenting aspects of informed decision making . Using an intention-to-treat analysis , men in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have made a screening decision and to have improved knowledge without increased decisional conflict , relative to men in the comparison group . These changes were observed despite the fact that only 30 % of men in intervention sites used the DA . Among DA users , similar improvements were observed , although the magnitudes of changes were substantially greater , and significant improvements in decision self-efficacy were observed . A DA offered in the workplace promoted decision making , improved knowledge , and increased decision self-efficacy among users , without increasing decisional conflict . However , participation was suboptimal , suggesting that better methods for engaging men in workplace interventions are needed . IMPACT STATEMENT : This trial shows the efficacy of a computer-tailored DA in promoting informed decisions about prostate cancer screening .

Eligible patients with histological or cytological diagnosis of stage IIIB or IV NSCLC , who were not suitable for curative therapy and had failed from prior first line chemotherapy regimen for at least 4 weeks , were randomized to receive either pemetrexed 500 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously day 1 with vitamin B12 , folic acid , and dexamethasone , or docetaxel 75 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously day 1 with dexamethasone . Both regimens were implemented once every 21 days for 2 cycles . This study was designed to be a non-inferiority trial that compared tumor response for overall response rate ( ORR ) between the two drugs as primary endpoint . The secondary endpoints included disease control rate ( DCR ) , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) scores and toxicities . 260 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy of either pemetrexed ( 132 patients ) or docetaxel ( 128 patients ) . 106 patients in pemetrexed arm and 102 patients in docetaxel arm were evaluable for efficacy .

Fifty participants with both baseline and follow-up fasting serum samples were randomly selected from each of these groups . Metabolomic profiling was conducted by mass spectrometry . The association between change in each metabolite over time and trial assignment ( - carotene or no - carotene ) was estimated by linear regression . We measured 489 metabolites , and 17 changed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) in response to - carotene supplementation . More of these 17 metabolites were of xenobiotic origin than would be expected by chance ( 9 of 60 , or 15 % ; P = 0.00004 ) . We also found a suggestive association with 1,5-anhydroglucitol-a marker of glycemic control ( = -0.379 , P = 0.0071 ) . Male smokers supplemented with - carotene developed metabolomic profiles consistent with the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes , the primary metabolizers of xenobiotics in humans .

One patient achieved a partial response in the R115777 arm . Stable disease ( > 3 months ) was observed in 24.3 % patients in the R115777 group compared to 12.8 % in the placebo arm . This did not translate into a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival . Overall , treatment was well tolerated . There was an increased incidence of reversible myelosuppression ( neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ) , rash , and grade 1 to 2 diarrhea in the R115777 arm . There was no statistically significant difference in quality of life between arms . Single agent R115777 , given at this dose and schedule , has an acceptable toxicity profile , but does not improve overall survival compared to best supportive care alone in refractory advanced CRC . \" \n",

QOL was measured in 163 patients , randomized to either a standard cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin and 5-flurouracil ( CAF ) or a 16-week multidrug regimen , using the Breast Chemotherapy Questionnaire ( BCQ ) . The 30 item BCQ was self-administered prior to therapy , during therapy , and 4 months post treatment . BCQ scores decreased ( worsened ) more during therapy on the 16-week regimen , median change -1.4 , than on CAF , median change -0.8 ( p < 0.001 ) . By 4 months post treatment , BCQ scores were higher than pre-treatment and equal in the two arms ( CAF : 8.1 and 16 weeks : 8.2 , p = 0.6 ) . Over a period of 48 months , patients on the 16-week regimen averaged 1.4 fewer months of treatment with toxicity , 4.0 more months without symptoms and 0.7 fewer months post recurrence compared to patients on the CAF regimen . Given typical values for these health states , the gain in Q-TWiST observed for the CAF regimen during treatment shifted to the 16-week regimen after 1 year , with a gain of 2.0 to 2.4 months after 4 years . The hypothesized negative impact of the dose intensive 16-week regimen was confirmed by the BCQ assessments . However , Q-TWiST analysis suggests a small gain for the 16-week regimen .

Furthermore , standard multiple regression analyses were performed . Results . Effect sizes between the subgroups `` Feeling like anyone else and `` Feeling almost like others and the group `` Feeling different were large for all dimensions ( 1.04-2 .07 ) ., The multiple regression models showed that being a survivor was significantly associated with one of the dimensions , School Environment , where survivors scored higher HRQoL .

In a randomized trial nested within a trial of treatments for localized prostate cancer , we investigated the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nurses and surgeons in recruiting patients . Men with localized prostate cancer were randomized to see a nurse or urologic surgeon for an `` information appointment in which they were asked to consent to the ProtecT treatment trial comparing surgery , radiotherapy , and active monitoring ., Analysis was conducted by intention to treat using chi-square with 95 % confidence intervals for proportions and differences between groups . An economic evaluation was performed using the duration of appointments and grade of recruitment staff . Case-finding identified 167 men with localized prostate cancer . One hundred fifty ( 90 % ) took part in the recruitment trial . There was a 4.0 % difference between nurses and surgeons in recruitment rates ( 67 % nurses , 71 % urologists , 95 % CI -10.8 % to +18.8 % , P = .60 ) . Cost-minimization analysis showed that nurses spent longer times with patients but surgeon costs were higher and nurses often supported surgeon-led clinics . Nurses were as effective and more cost-effective recruiters than urologic surgeons . This suggests an increased role for nurses in recruiting patients to randomized trials . \" \n",

Results , however , are heterogeneous at lower levels of alcohol intake , and a biologic mechanism for the association has not been clearly identified . To determine whether alcohol consumption by postmenopausal women elevates serum levels of hormones associated with an increased risk of breast cancer , we performed a controlled feeding study . Participants were 51 healthy postmenopausal women not using hormone replacement therapy . Each participant rotated through three 8-week dietary periods in which she consumed 15 or 30 g of alcohol per day or an alcohol-free placebo beverage . The order of assignment to the three alcohol levels was random . During the dietary periods , all food and beverages were supplied by the study , and energy intake was adjusted to keep body weight constant . Levels of estradiol , estrone , estrone sulfate , testosterone , androstenedione , progesterone , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , DHEA sulfate ( DHEAS ) , and androstenediol were measured by radioimmunoassays in serum collected at the end of each dietary period . All statistical tests are two-sided . When women consumed 15 or 30 g of alcohol per day , respectively , estrone sulfate concentrations increased by 7.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  = -0.3 % to 15.9 % ; P = .06 ) and 10.7 % ( 95 % CI = 2.7 % to 19.3 % ; P = .009 ) and DHEAS concentrations increased by 5.1 % ( 95 % CI = 1.4 % to 9.0 % ; P = .008 ) and 7.5 % ( 95 % CI = 3.7 % to 11.5 % ; P < .001 ) relative to levels when women consumed placebo . None of the other hormones measured changed statistically significantly when women consumed alcohol . Results suggest a possible mechanism by which consumption of one or two alcoholic drinks per day by postmenopausal women could increase their risk of breast cancer . \" \n",

Seven days after the end of the second source of CT , all patients underwent control esophagogastroduodenoscopy . Endoscopic findings were quantified on the basis of an arbitrary score : 0 = normal ; 1 = less than 3 erosions ; 2 = 3-15 erosions ; 3 = more than 15 erosions or ulcer ; 4 = giant ulcer ( greatest dimension of more than 2 cm ) or multiple ulcers with cumulative greatest dimension exceeding 2 cm . Mean score increased significantly in the placebo and misoprostol groups , either after CMF ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 , respectively ) or after 5-FU ( P < 0.001 for both ) , whereas it did not in the omeprazole group . Gastric and duodenal ulcers were significantly less frequent in patients receiving omeprazole than in those receiving placebo ( P < 0.05 after both CMF and 5-FU ) . No significant difference was observed between placebo and misoprostol . Omeprazole was significantly more effective than placebo and misoprostol in reducing the frequency and degree of the endoscopic worsening , either after CMF or after 5-FU ( P < 0.05 for both CT regimens ) . Epigastric pain and/or heartburn were significantly less frequent in patients receiving omeprazole than in those receiving placebo ( P < 0.01 ) or misoprostol ( P < 0.001 ) . The strong and prolonged inhibition of gastric acid production induced by omeprazole seems to be effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury .

Working time of the different occupational groups and room occupancies for the workflow of prostate BRT were recorded and methodically assessed during a 3-month period . For HDR and LDR BRT , a total of 560 and 92 measurements , respectively , were documented . The time needed for treatment preplanning was median 24min for HDR ( n = 112 measurements ) and 6min for LDR BRT ( n = 21 ) . Catheter implantation with intraoperative HDR real-time planning ( n = 112 ) , postimplantation HDR treatment planning ( n = 112 ) , and remotely controlled HDR afterloading irradiation ( n = 112 ) required median 25 , 39 , and 50min , respectively . For LDR real-time planning ( n = 39 ) and LDR treatment postplanning ( n = 32 ) , the assessed median duration was 91 and 11min , respectively . Room occupancy and overall mean medical staff times were 194 and 910min respectively , for HDR , and 113 and 371min , respectively , for LDR BRT . In this prospective analysis , the resource requirements for the application of HDR and LDR BRT of prostate cancer were assessed methodically and are presented for first time . \" \n",

Although small differences would be worthwhile , an appropriately powered randomized trial would need to be very large , and thus of doubtful feasibility given the expense , complexity and regulatory burden of contemporary clinical trials . We have proposed a novel methodology , the clinically-integrated randomized trial , which dramatically streamlines trial procedures in order to reduce the marginal cost of an additional patient towards zero . We aimed to determine the feasibility of implementing such a trial for radical prostatectomy . Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as initial treatment for prostate cancer were randomized in a factorial design to involvement of the fascia during placement of the anastomotic sutures , urethral irrigation , both or neither . Endpoint data were obtained from routine clinical documentation . Accrual and compliance rates were monitored to determine the feasibility of the trial . From a total of 260 eligible patients , 154 ( 59 % ) consented ; 56 patients declined to participate , 20 were not approached on recommendation of the treating surgeon , and 30 were not approached for logistical reasons . Although recording by surgeons of the procedure used was incomplete ( ~ 80 % ) , compliance with randomization was excellent when it was recorded , with only 6 % of procedures inconsistent with allocation . Outcomes data was received from 71 % of patients at one year . This improved to 83 % as the trial progressed . A clinically-integrated randomized trial was conducted at low cost , with excellent accrual , and acceptable compliance with treatment allocation and outcomes reporting .

In this pilot study , the authors ( 1 ) addressed whether conducting a larger randomized controlled trial of aqua lymphatic therapy ( ALT ) would be feasible and ( 2 ) estimated the extent to which ALT combined with home-based exercise compared with home-based exercise alone would reduce arm disability in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema . Twenty-five women with breast cancer-related lymphedema were randomized to either ALT in addition to a home land-based exercise program ( ALT group ; n = 13 ) or to a home land-based exercise program alone ( control group ; n = 12 ) . The participants were evaluated before and after a 12-wk intervention period composed of weekly pool exercise sessions . Main outcome measures were arm volume , arm disability , pain , and quality-of-life . At follow-up , there was no statistical difference between the control and ALT groups in any of the outcomes , except for present pain intensity . At the end of the study period , there was no change in the lymphedematous limb volume in either group . Grip strength was improved in both groups . Only the ALT group showed a statistically significant difference with a reduction in pain intensity score and arm disability . Furthermore , quality-of-life significantly improved only in the ALT group . Conducting a larger randomized controlled trial would be feasible . In comparison with the beginning of the intervention , the participants in the ALT group showed significant beneficial changes after 12 wks of treatment , whereas the control group did not improve . ALT did not make the lymphedema volume worse and therefore may serve as a safe alternative to land-based treatments of breast cancer-related lymphedema . \" \n",

Glucobrassicin is a predominant glucosinolate and is the precursor of indole-3-carbinol ( I3C ) , a compound with anticancer effects . However , objective assessments of I3C uptake from Brassica vegetables have not been successful . We conducted a randomized , crossover trial to test whether 3,3 - diindolylmethane ( DIM , a metabolite of I3C ) excreted in the urine after consumption of raw Brassica vegetables with divergent glucobrassicin concentrations is a marker of I3C uptake from such foods ., Twenty-five subjects were fed 50 g of either raw `` Jade Cross Brussels sprouts ( high glucobrassicin concentration ) or `` Blue Dynasty cabbage ( low glucobrassicin concentration ) once daily for 3 days ., All urine was collected for 24 hours after vegetable consumption each day . After a washout period , subjects crossed over to the alternate vegetable . Urinary DIM was measured using a novel liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring ( LC-ESI-MS/MS-SRM ) method with  ( 2 ) H2  DIM as internal standard . Urinary DIM was consistently and significantly higher after Brussels sprouts feeding than after cabbage feeding , as evidenced by an average difference of 8.73 pmol/mg creatinine ( 95 % confidence interval , 5.36-12 .10 ; P = 0.00002 ) . We have successfully quantified urinary DIM after uptake of I3C from food , and demonstrated that differences in glucobrassicin exposure are reflected in urinary DIM levels . Our LC-ESI-MS/MS-SRM method and the results of our study indicate urinary DIM is a measure of I3C uptake from Brassica vegetables , a finding that can be utilized in prospective epidemiologic and chemoprevention studies . \" \n",

This evaluates early impact of adjuvant brachytherapy on pulmonary function tests , dyspnea , and perioperative ( 30-day ) respiratory complications in this impaired patient population . Eligible patients with stage I NSCLC tumors 3 cm or smaller were randomly allocated to undergo sublobar resection with ( SRB group ) or without ( SR group ) brachytherapy . Outcomes measured included the percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 % ) , percentage predicted carbon monoxide diffusion capacity ( DLCO % ) , and dyspnea score per the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire . Pulmonary morbidity was assessed per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 . Outcomes were measured at baseline and 3 months . A 10 % change in pulmonary function test or 10-point change in dyspnea score was deemed clinically meaningful . Z4032 permanently closed to patient accrual in January 2010 at 224 patients . At 3-month follow-up , pulmonary function data are currently available for 148 ( 74 SR and 74 SRB ) patients described in this report . There were no differences in baseline characteristics between arms . In the SR arm , 9 patients ( 12 % ) reported grade 3 respiratory adverse events , compared with 12 ( 16 % ) in the SRB arm ( P = .49 ) . There was no significant change in percentage change in DLCO % or dyspnea score from baseline to 3 months within either arm . In the case of FEV1 % , percentage change from baseline to 3 months was significant within the SR arm ( P = .03 ) , with patients reporting improvement in FEV1 % at month 3 . Multivariable regression analysis ( adjusted for baseline values ) showed no significant impact of treatment arm , tumor location ( upper vs other lobe ) , or surgical approach ( video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vs thoracotomy ) on 3-month FEV1 % , DLCO % , and dyspnea score . There was no significant difference in incidence of clinically meaningful ( 10 % pulmonary function or 10-point dyspnea score change ) change between arms . Twenty-two percent of patients with lower-lobe tumors and 9 % with upper-lobe tumors demonstrated 10 % decline in FEV1 % ( odds ratio , 2.79 ; 95 confidence interval , 1.07-7 .25 ; P = .04 ) . Adjuvant intraoperative brachytherapy in conjunction with sublobar resection did not significantly worsen pulmonary function or dyspnea at 3 months in a high-risk population with NSCLC , nor was it associated with increased perioperative pulmonary adverse events . Lower-lobe resection was the only factor significantly associated with clinically meaningful decline in FEV1 % . \" \n",

Individually randomized controlled trial . Fifteen urban centres in Canada with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer . Women with no history of breast cancer and no mammography in the previous 12 months were randomly assigned to undergo either annual mammography and physical examination ( MP group ) or annual physical examination only ( PO group ) . The 39,405 women enrolled from January 1980 through March 1985 were followed for a mean of 8.3 years . Derived from the participants by initial and annual self-administered questionnaires , from the screening examinations , from the patients physicians , from the provincial cancer registries and by record linkage to the Canadian National Mortality Data Base ., Expert panels evaluated histologic and death data . Rates of referral from screening , rates of detection of breast cancer from screening and from community care , nodal status , tumour size and rates of death from all causes and from breast cancer . Over 85 % of the women in each group attended the screening sessions after screen 1 . The characteristics of the women in the two groups were similar . Compared with the Canadian population the participants were more likely to be married , have fewer children , have more education , be in a professional occupation , smoke less and have been born in North America . The rate of screen-detected breast cancer on first examination was 7.20 per 1000 in the MP group and 3.45 per 1000 in the PO group , more node-positive tumours were found in the MP group than in the PO group . At subsequent screens the detection rates were a little less than half the rates at screen 1 . During years 2 through 5 the ratios of observed to expected cases of invasive breast cancer were 1.28 in the MP group and 1.18 in the PO group . Of the women with invasive breast cancer through to 7 years , 217 in the MP group and 184 in the PO group had no node involvement , 66 and 56 had one to three nodes involved , 32 and 34 had four or more nodes involved , and 55 and 46 had an unknown nodal status . There were 38 deaths from breast cancer in the MP group and 39 in the PO group . The ratio of the proportions of death from breast cancer in the MP group compared with those in the UC group was 0.97 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.62 to 1.52 ) . The survival rates were similar in the two groups . Women whose cancer had been detected by mammography alone had the highest survival rate . The study was internally valid , and there was no evidence of randomization bias . Screening with yearly mammography in addition to physical examination of the breasts detected considerably more node-negative , small tumours than screening with physical examination alone , but it had no impact on the rate of death from breast cancer up to 7 years follow-up from entry ., \" \n",

We sought to determine whether pretreatment with an antibiotic could reduce F-FDG uptake in the healthy colon . Thirty patients undergoing restaging PET/CT for nongastrointestinal lymphoma were randomly selected to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice daily for 2 days before their scan ( post-rifaximin ) .

All PET/CT images were blindly scored by a radiologist . The same comparison of sequential scans was also undertaken in 30 patients who did not receive antibiotics . Thirty post-rifaximin scans were compared with 30 pre-rifaximin scans in the same patients . SUVmax in the cecum was significantly lower in the patient s post-rifaximin scans than in their pre-rifaximin scans ( P = 0.002 ) ., The percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the post-rifaximin scans than in the pre-rifaximin scans ( P < 0.05 ) . In contrast , there was no significant difference in the paired sequential scans from control patients , nor a reduction in the percentage of scans with greater than grade 1 colonic F-FDG uptake . This pilot study shows that treatment with rifaximin for 2 days before PET/CT scanning can significantly reduce physiological F-FDG uptake in the normal colonic lumen . \" \n",

The primary end point was recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) . During a median follow-up time of 59 months , 214 RFS events occurred ( local or distant recurrences or deaths ; TX/CEX , n = 96 ; T/CEF , n = 118 ) . RFS was not significantly different between the groups ( hazard ratio  HR  , 0.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 to 1.04 ; P = .087 ; 5-year RFS , 86.6 % for TX/CEX v 84.1 % for T/CEF ) . Fifty-six patients assigned to TX/CEX died during the follow-up compared with 75 of patients assigned to T/CEF ( HR , 0.73 ; 95 % CI , 0.52 to 1.04 ; P = .080 ) . In exploratory analyses , TX/CEX improved breast cancer-specific survival ( HR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.44 to 0.95 ; P = .027 ) and RFS in women with triple-negative disease and in women who had more than three metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis . We detected little severe late toxicity . Integration of capecitabine into a regimen that contains docetaxel , epirubicin , and cyclophosphamide did not improve RFS significantly compared with a similar regimen without capecitabine . \" \n",

However , it is unclear whether robot-assisted colectomy ( RAC ) has significant clinical advantages over laparoscopically assisted colectomy ( LAC ) in treating colonic cancer . The aim of this study was to compare the surgical outcomes of RAC versus LAC for right-sided colonic cancer . Patients with right-sided colonic cancer were randomized to receive RAC or LAC . The primary outcome measure was length of hospital stay . Secondary outcomes were duration of operation , morbidity , postoperative pain , hospital costs and pathological quality of the specimen . Of 71 patients randomized , 70 ( 35 in each group ) were included in the analysis . Hospital stay , surgical complications , postoperative pain score , resection margin clearance and number of lymph nodes harvested were similar in both groups . The duration of surgery was longer in the RAC group ( 195 versus 130 min ; P < 0001 ) . No conversion to open surgery was needed in either group . Overall hospital costs were significantly higher for RAC ( US $ 12,235 versus $ 10,320 ; P = 0013 ) ; the higher costs were attributed primarily to the costs of surgery , including consumables . Robotic-assisted laparoscopic right colectomy was feasible but provided no benefit to justify the greater cost . NCT01042743 ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Locally advanced rectal cancer ( LARC ) is a heterogeneous group of tumors where a risk-adapted therapeutic strategy is needed . Short-course radiotherapy ( SCRT ) is a more convenient option for LARC patients than preoperative long-course RT plus capecitabine . Histone-deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) have shown activity in combination with RT and chemotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors . Valproic acid ( VPA ) is an anti-epileptic drug with HDACi and anticancer activity . In preclinical studies , our group showed that the addition of HDACi , including VPA , to capecitabine produces synergistic antitumour effects by up-regulating thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) , the key enzyme converting capecitabine to 5-FU , and by downregulating thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , the 5-FU target . Two parallel phase-1 studies will assess the safety of preoperative SCRT ( 5 fractions each of 5Gy , on days 1 to 5 ) combined with ( a ) capecitabine alone ( increasing dose levels : 500-825mg / m2/bid ) , on days 1-21 , or ( b ) capecitabine as above plus VPA ( oral daily day -14 to 21 , with an intra-patient titration for a target serum level of 50-100 microg/ml ) followed by surgery 8weeks after the end of SCRT , in low-moderate risk RC patients . Also , a randomized phase-2 study will be performed to explore whether the addition of VPA and/or capecitabine to preoperative SCRT might increase pathologic complete tumor regression ( TRG1 ) rate . A sample size of 86 patients ( 21-22 / arm ) was calculated under the hypothesis that the addition of capecitabine or VPA to SCRT can improve the TRG1 rate from 5 % to 20 % , with one-sided alpha = 0.10 and 80 % power.Several biomarkers will be evaluated comparing normal mucosa with tumor ( TP , TS , VEGF , RAD51 , XRCC1 , Histones/proteins acetylation , HDAC isoforms ) and on blood samples ( polymorphisms of DPD , TS , XRCC1 , GSTP1 , RAD51 and XRCC3 , circulating endothelial and progenitors cells ; PBMCs-Histones/proteins acetylation ) . Tumor metabolism will be measured by 18FDG-PET at baseline and 15days after the beginning of SCRT . This project aims to improve the efficacy of preoperative treatment of LARC and to decrease the inconvenience and the cost of standard long-course RT. . Correlative studies could identify both prognostic and predictive biomarkers and could add new insight in the mechanism of interaction between VPA , capecitabine and RT.EudraCT Number : 2012-002831-28 .

Patients were randomly assigned to three cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by surgery ( chemotherapy arm ) or surgery alone ( control arm ) . In both arms , postoperative radiotherapy was reserved to high-risk patients , and surgery was modulated depending on the tumor s closeness to the mandible ., Patients accrual was opened in 1989 and closed in 1999 ., It included 195 patients . In the chemotherapy arm , three toxic deaths were recorded . No significant difference in overall survival was found . Five-year overall survival was , for both arms , 55 % . Postoperative radiotherapy was administered in 33 % of patients in the chemotherapy arm , versus 46 % in the control arm . A mandible resection was performed in 52 % of patients in the control arm , versus 31 % in the chemotherapy arm . The addition of primary chemotherapy to standard surgery was unable to improve survival . However , in this study , primary chemotherapy seemed to play a role in reducing the number of patients who needed to undergo mandibulectomy and/or radiation therapy . Variations in the criteria used to select patients for these treatment options may make it difficult to generalize these results , but there appears to be room for using preoperative chemotherapy to spare destructive surgery or radiation therapy in patients with advanced , resectable oral cavity cancer . \" \n",

They completed a battery of standardized instruments to assess quality of life ( QL ) , rehabilitation needs , and psychologic distress . The primary QL instrument , the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System ( CARES ) , provides a detailed listing of rehabilitation needs . Descriptive CARES data are presented with comparisons between the two groups . The at-risk women had significantly more problems with greater severity than the low-risk women in all areas ( physical , psychosocial , medical interaction , sexual , and marital ) . While both groups showed improvement over the year following diagnosis , the at-risk group had significantly more problems 1 year later . Many physical problems subside , but problems at the local surgical site , psychologic distress , communication with marital partners , and negative body image are more persistent in the at-risk group 1 year later , while half of both groups continue to have sexual dysfunction . The detailed listing of problems provided by the CARES may be helpful to clinicians in their interactions with patients .

This trial involved patients with biopsy-proven , advanced carcinoma of the pancreas not amenable to surgical resection . Patients were randomized to receive either gemcitabine alone ( 1,000 mg/m ( 2 ) / wk ) weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 or to receive gemcitabine ( 1,000 mg/m ( 2 ) / wk ) followed by 5-FU ( 600 mg/m ( 2 ) / wk ) weekly on the same schedule . The primary end point of the trial was survival , with secondary end points of time to progression and response rate . Of 327 patients enrolled over 18 months , 322 were eligible . Overall , the median survival was 5.4 months for gemcitabine alone and 6.7 months for gemcitabine plus 5-FU ( P = .09 ) .

Baseline HRQOL scores ( from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer  EORTC  Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the EORTC Brain Cancer Module ) were examined in 247 patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas to determine the relationship with overall survival by using Cox proportional hazards regression models . Refined techniques as the bootstrap resampling procedure and the computation of C indexes and R2 coefficients were used to explore the stability of the models as well as better assess the potential benefit of using HRQOL to predict survival in clinical practice and research . Classical analysis controlled for major clinical prognostic factors selected emotional functioning ( P = .0016 ) , communication deficit ( P = .0261 ) , future uncertainty ( P = .0481 ) , and weakness of legs ( P = .0001 ) as statistically significant prognostic factors of survival . However , several issues question the validity of these findings and no single model was found to be preferable over all others . C indexes , which estimate the probability of a model to correctly predict which patient among a randomly chosen pair of patients will survive longer , and R2 coefficients , which measure the proportion of variability explained by the model , did not exhibit major improvement when adding selected or all HRQOL scores to clinical factors . While classical techniques lead to positive results , more refined analyses suggest that baseline HRQOL scores add relatively little to clinical factors to predict survival . These results may have implications for future use of HRQOL as a prognostic factor for patients with cancer . \" \n",

Treatment with preoperative radiotherapy might have an effect on the pathologic characteristics that determine staging of rectal cancer . We investigated the occurrence of downstaging in rectal cancer patients treated with and without preoperative radiotherapy . We analyzed the differences in tumor size , number of examined lymph nodes , tumor-node-metastasis stage , and histopathologic features in 1,321 patients entered onto a randomized trial . The trial compared preoperative radiotherapy ( 5 x 5 Gy ) followed by TME surgery with TME surgery alone . Patients who had an interval of more than 10 days between the start of radiotherapy and surgery were excluded from analysis .

In this randomized controlled trial , 442 patients with breast cancer who were completing their adjuvant radiotherapy were recruited and randomized to receive either usual care , which includes standard print material ( CRL group n = 226 ) or usual care and the GBOT group intervention ( INT group n = 216 ) . Participants completed measures at baseline and again at 3 and 6 months post-intervention . The INT group showed significant improvement in their knowledge regarding the re-entry transition period ( d = 0.31 ) and in their feelings of preparedness for re-entry ( d = 0.37 ) . There were no differences between the groups over time on health-related distress or mood . Results support the effectiveness of providing a single-session group psychoeducational intervention as a first-step approach to supportive care for women at the end of breast cancer treatment . \" \n",

Markers of such a response might be detected in the pulmonary as well as in the systemic circulation . Inflammation and tissue damage may be key pathogenetic pathways and we hypothesized that 1-lung ventilation may induce an inflammatory cascade reflected by markers for such a response . Thirty patients with esophageal cancer were randomized to OLV ( n = 16 ) or 2-lung ventilation ( TLV ; n = 14 ) during the thoracic part of the operation . Compounds involved in inflammation and coagulation were measured perioperatively and during the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and 10th postoperative d. During the perioperative phase , the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and thrombin , measured as thrombin-antithrombin complexes , started to increase . Thrombin , which can induce complement activation , peaked at the end of surgery and interleukin-6 at the 1st to 2nd postoperative d , but there were no differences between the OLV and TLV groups . C3a and terminal complement complex ( TCC ) started to increase on the 2nd postoperative d and continued to do so for the rest of the study period . The increase of TCC was significantly higher in the OLV group compared to the TLV group , whereas C3a attained similar levels in the 2 groups . OLV is associated with an augmented inflammatory response as reflected by the activation of the TCC . This may induce pulmonary tissue damage and recruitment of inflammatory cells . \" \n",

Fifty patients with metastatic breast cancer , measurable disease , and normal left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) were eligible . Epirubicin was administered as an intravenous ( I.V. ) bolus at the fixed dose of 90 mg/m2 before the infusion of paclitaxel over 3 hours . The initial dose of paclitaxel was 135 mg/m2 and was increased by 20 mg/m2 in subsequent cohorts of six patients until dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and epirubicin was performed at cycle 1 in at least two patients per dose level of paclitaxel ( 175 up to 225 mg/m2 ) . The DLT of this combination was febrile neutropenia in two of eight patients who received paclitaxel at 225 mg/m2 . The mean peak plasma concentration of paclitaxel ranged between 5.1 and 6.2 micromol/L at doses of 175 to 225 mg/m2 . The concentration of epirubicinol decreased from 47.3 + / - 9.4 to 37.9 + / - 7.5 ng/mL in patients treated with paclitaxel 175 and 225 mg/m2 . The most relevant toxicity was grade 4 neutropenia ( 61 % of all courses ) . The pharmacokinetic data of paclitaxel , in particular the time above the threshold level of 0.05 micromol/L , were not significantly related to myelosuppression .

Among 49 assessable patients , 41 responses ( 84 % ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 70 % to 92 % ) were observed , and nine ( 18 % ) of these were complete . Our study demonstrates that ( 1 ) the MTD is epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 ; ( 2 ) no clear relationship exists between pharmacokinetic data of paclitaxel and myelosuppression , while the increase in the dose of paclitaxel is associated with a reduction in epirubicinol plasma levels ; and ( 3 ) the association is feasible , with low cardiotoxicity , and has a high activity in metastatic breast cancer . \" \n",

Of the 452 enrolled patients , 314 were randomly assigned to the groups . One-year survival rates were 59.0 % in arm A and 62.4 % in arm B , and the difference of 3.4 % ( 95 % CI , -8.0 to 4.8 ) met the predefined criteria for noninferiority . The median time to progression ( TTP ) , however , was 6.2 months ( 95 % CI , 5.7 to 6.7 months ) in arm A and 4.6 months ( 95 % CI , 4.4 to 4.8 months ) in arm B , the difference of which is statistically significant ( P = .001 ) . The frequencies of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were similar in the two arms . This study confirms the noninferiority of overall survival with four cycles compared with six cycles of chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC and supports the current American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines . Notably , patients receiving six cycles of chemotherapy compared with four cycles showed a favorable TTP , suggesting that further investigation of the new strategies of maintenance therapy with less toxic agents after three to four cycles of induction chemotherapy might be warranted to improve survival , with consideration of both ethnicity and pharmacogenomic signatures . \" \n",

Sixty-three men scheduled to receive ADT were randomly assigned to a 3-month supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise sessions commenced within 10 days of their first ADT injection ( 32 men ) or usual care ( 31 men ) . The primary outcome was body composition ( lean and fat mass ) . Other study outcomes included bone mineral density , physical function , blood biomarkers of chronic disease risk and bone turnover , general and prostate cancer-specific quality of life , fatigue and psychological distress . Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values . Compared to usual care , a 3-month exercise programme preserved appendicular lean mass ( P = 0.019 ) and prevented gains in whole body fat mass , trunk fat mass and percentage fat with group differences of -1.4 kg ( P = 0.001 ) , -0.9 kg ( P = 0.008 ) and -1.3 % ( P < 0.001 ) , respectively . Significant between-group differences were also seen favouring the exercise group for cardiovascular fitness ( peak oxygen consumption 1.1 mL/kg/min , P = 0.004 ) , muscular strength ( 4.0-25 .9 kg , P 0.026 ) , lower body function ( -1.1 s , P < 0.001 ) , total cholesterol : high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio ( -0.52 , P = 0.028 ) , sexual function ( 15.2 , P = 0.028 ) , fatigue ( 3.1 , P = 0.042 ) , psychological distress ( -2.2 , P = 0.045 ) , social functioning ( 3.8 , P = 0.015 ) and mental health ( 3.6-3 .8 , P 0.022 ) . There were no significant group differences for any other outcomes . Commencing a supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise when initiating ADT significantly reduced treatment toxicity , while improving social functioning and mental health . Concurrent prescription of supervised exercise when initiating ADT is therefore advised to minimise morbidity associated with severe hypogonadism . \" \n",

Currently , lung cancers are mainly diagnosed by general practitioners ( GPs ) using the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guidelines for urgent referral for chest X-ray , which recommend urgent imaging or referral for patients who have one of a number of chest symptoms for more than 3 weeks . We are proposing to expand this recommendation to include one of a number of chest symptoms of any duration in higher-risk patients . We intend to conduct a trial of imaging in these higher-risk patients and compare it with NICE guidelines to see if imaging improves stage at diagnosis and resection rates . This trial would have to be large ( and consequently resource-intensive ) because most of these patients will not have lung cancer , making optimal design crucial . We are therefore conducting a pilot trial that will ascertain the feasibility of running a full trial and provide key information that will be required in order to design the full trial .

The daily biological need for vitamin A is estimated to be 800 retinol equivalents ( RE ) / d ( 2667 IU/d ) for adult women and 1000 RE/d ( 3300 IU/d ) for adult men ; doses > or = 7500 RE ( > or = 25000 IU ) / d are considered potentially toxic over the long term . We assessed the safety in adults of long-term vitamin A supplementation with doses above the daily biological need but < 7500 RE ( < 25000 IU ) / d. Adults aged 18-54 y with retinitis pigmentosa but in generally good health ( n = 146 ) were supplemented with 4500 RE ( 15000 IU ) vitamin A/d for < or = 12 y ( group A ) and compared with a similar group ( n = 149 ) that received 23 RE ( 75 IU ) / d ( trace group ) . Mean total consumption of vitamin A in group A was 5583 RE ( 18609 IU ) / d ( range : 4911-7296 RE/d , or 16369-24318 IU/d ) and that in the trace group was 1053 RE ( 3511 IU ) / d ( range : 401-3192 RE/d , or 1338-10638 IU/d ) . Patients in group A showed an 8 % increase in mean serum retinol concentration at 5 y and an 18 % increase at 12 y ( P < 0.001 ) ; no retinol value exceeded the upper normal limit ( 3.49 micromol/L , or 100 microg/dL ) . Mean serum retinyl esters were elevated approximately 1.7-fold at 5 y and remained relatively stable thereafter . No clinical symptoms or signs of liver toxicity attributable to vitamin A excess were detected . Prolonged daily consumption of < 7500 RE ( < 25000 IU ) vitamin A/d can be considered safe in this age group . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Although alcohol intake has been positively associated with breast cancer risk in epidemiologic studies , a causal relationship has not been established , and the mechanisms mediating this association are speculative . Alcohol may act through altered status of folate and vitamin B ( 12 ) , two vitamins required for DNA methylation and nucleotide synthesis , and thus cell integrity . Although the effects of heavy alcohol intake on folate and vitamin B ( 12 ) status have been well-documented , few studies have addressed the effects of moderate alcohol intake in a controlled setting . The objective of this study was to determine the effects of moderate alcohol intake on folate and vitamin B ( 12 ) status in healthy , well-nourished , postmenopausal women . The study design was a randomized , diet-controlled crossover intervention . Postmenopausal women ( n = 53 ) received three 8-week alcohol treatments in random order : 0 , 15 , and 30 g/day . Treatment periods were preceded by 2-5-week washout periods . Blood collected at baseline and week 8 of each treatment period was analyzed for serum folate , vitamin B ( 12 ) , homocysteine ( HCY ) , and methylmalonic acid ( MMA ) concentrations . After adjusting for body mass index ( BMI ) , a significant 5 % decrease was observed in mean serum vitamin B ( 12 ) concentrations from 0 to 30 g of alcohol/day ( 461.45 + / -30.26 vs 440.25 + / -30.24 pg/ml ; P = 0.03 ) . Mean serum HCY concentrations tended to increase by 3 % from 0 to 30 g of alcohol/day ( 9.44 + / -0.37 vs 9.73 + / -0.37 micromol/l ; P = 0.05 ) . Alcohol intake had no significant effects on serum folate or MMA concentrations . Among healthy , well-nourished , postmenopausal women , moderate alcohol intake may diminish vitamin B ( 12 ) status . \" \n",

Most commonly reported PF-3512676-related adverse events ( AEs ) were mild-to-moderate local injection site reactions , pyrexia , and flu-like symptoms . In the investigational arm , grades 3 to 4 AEs , including neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and anemia , were more frequent , and more patients had one or more sepsis-related AEs versus controls ( 17 v 3 ) . At first interim analysis , the Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended study discontinuation because of lack of incremental efficacy and more sepsis-related serious AEs in the PF-3512676 arm . Administration of PF-3512676 , but not chemotherapy , was halted . Addition of PF-3512676 to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve OS or PFS versus paclitaxel/carboplatin alone for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC but did increase toxicity .

Patients received fluorouracil ( 5FU ) 500 mg/m2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 , and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 every 21 days intravenously ( IV ) ( control regimen , 74 patients ) , or the same regimen preceded by ICRF-187 1,000 mg/m2 IV ( experimental regimen , 76 patients ) . We previously reported that ICRF-187 in this dose and schedule provides cardiac protection and does not substantially alter the noncardiac toxicity or antitumor efficacy of the control regimen . In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort , we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles ( median , 11 ) and higher cumulative doses ( median , 500 mg/m2 ) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group ( median , nine cycles , P less than .01 ; and 441 mg/m2 , P less than .05 ) . Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2 , and among them , 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more . Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2 ; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2 . ICRF-187 cardiac protection was demonstrated by difference in incidence of clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ; two patients in the ICRF-187 group v 20 in the control group ; P less than .0001 ) and by differences in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) determined by multigated radionuclide ( MUGA ) scan from baselines and that required patient removal from study ( five patients in the ICRF-187 group had a decrease in LVEF to less than 0.45 or a decrease from the baseline LVEF of 0.20 or more v 32 in the control group ; P less than .000001 ) . Among the 30 patients who had an assessable endomyocardial biopsy at cumulative doxorubicin 450 mg/m2 , none of 16 in the ICRF-187 group and six of 14 in the control group had a score of 2 ( P less than .05 ) . ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity . By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity , ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety . \" \n",

There were a total of four catheter infections in the test group and 12 in the control group ( P = 0.03 , chi-square test ) . The catheter-related septicemia rate was 6.3 times higher in the control group ( P = 0.06 , Fisher s exact test ) ., Most ( 67 % ) of the catheter infections in the control group occurred during the first 2 months after insertion , whereas 25 % of the catheter infections in the maximal sterile precautions group occurred during the same period ( P < 0.01 , Fisher s exact test ) ., Cost-benefit analysis showed the use of such precautions to be highly cost-effective . Maximal sterile barrier precautions during the insertion of nontunneled catheters reduce the risk of catheter infection . This practice is cost-effective and is consistent with the practice of universal precautions during an invasive procedure . \" \n",

We studied 173 patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of oral clodronate 1,600 mg/d ( 85 patients ) compared with an identical placebo ( 88 patients ) . The patients in each wing were comparable in their clinical , radiologic , and biochemical characteristics at trial entry . In patients who received clodronate , there was a significant reduction compared with placebo in the total number of hypercalcemic episodes ( 28 v 52 ; P < .01 ) , in the number of terminal hypercalcemic episodes ( seven v 17 ; P < .05 ) , in the incidence of vertebral fractures ( 84 v 124 per 100 patient-years ; P < .025 ) , and in the rate of vertebral deformity ( 168 v 252 per 100 patient-years ; P < .001 ) . The combined rate of all morbid skeletal events was significantly reduced ( 218.6 v 304.8 per 100 patient-years ; P < .001 ) . Trends were seen in favor of clodronate for nonvertebral fracture rates and radiotherapy requirements for bone pain ( particularly spinal pain ) . No significant survival differences and no significant differences in side effects were observed between the two groups . These findings indicate that oral clodronate has a beneficial effect on the skeletal morbidity associated with breast cancer and should be considered as antiosteolytic therapy in affected patients .

We examined the relationship between serum total and HDL cholesterol and risk of overall and site-specific cancers among 29,093 men in the Alpha-Tocopherol , Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention ( ATBC ) Study cohort . Fasting serum total and HDL cholesterol were assayed at baseline , and 7,545 incident cancers were identified during up to 18 years of follow-up . Multivariable proportional hazards models were conducted to estimate relative risks ( RR ) . Higher serum total cholesterol concentration was associated with decreased risk of cancer overall ( RR for comparing high versus low quintile , 0.85 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.79-0 .91 ; P trend < 0.001 ; > 276.7 versus < 203.9 mg/dL ) , and the inverse association was particularly evident for cancers of the lung and liver . These associations were no longer significant , however , when cases diagnosed during the first 9 years of follow-up were excluded .

Addition of a conventional anti-diabetic dose of metformin does not improve outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine and erlotinib . Future research should include studies of more potent biguanides , and should focus on patients with hyperinsulinaemia and patients with tumours showing markers of sensitivity to energetic stress , such as loss of function of AMP kinase , a key regulator of cellular energy homoeostasis .

We investigated the recommended doses of docetaxel-carboplatin in Japanese patients with ovarian cancer and conducted a comparative study of docetaxel-carboplatin versus paclitaxel-carboplatin . Thirty-nine patients with ovarian cancer were enrolled in this study and 38 patients were evaluated . We conducted a dose-escalation study using a docetaxel dose of 70 mg/m ( 2 ) and carboplatin AUC 5 and 6 . In the comparative study , patients received either docetaxel 70 mg/m ( 2 ) and carboplatin AUC 5 or paclitaxel 175 mg/m ( 2 ) and carboplatin AUC 5 . Progression-free survival , survival rate at 2 years , response rate , toxicity , and quality of life were investigated . In the dose-finding study , we determined the recommended doses as docetaxel 70 mg/m ( 2 ) and carboplatin AUC 5 . In the comparative study , the two arms showed similar progression-free survival . Grade 4 neutropenia occurred more frequently in the docetaxel-carboplatin group ( 84.6 % ) than in the paclitaxel-carboplatin group ( 43.8 % ) , while sensory neurotoxicity was less frequent in the docetaxel-carboplatin group ( 53.8 % ) than in the paclitaxel-carboplatin ( 68.8 % ) group . There were significant differences in the quality-of-life data in favor of docetaxel-carboplatin . We determined the recommended doses of docetaxel-carboplatin for Japanese patients with ovarian cancer to be docetaxel 70 mg/m ( 2 ) and carboplatin AUC 5 . In the comparative study , we suggest that the docetaxel-carboplatin combination is effective and well tolerated as first-line chemotherapy for Japanese patients with ovarian cancer . \" \n",

However , most transplants fail after 10 to 12 years , consigning patients back onto dialysis . Damage by the immune system accounts for approximately 50 % of failing transplants and it is possible to identify patients at risk by screening for the presence of antibodies against human leukocyte antigens . However , it is not clear how best to treat patients with antibodies . This trial will test a combined screening and treatment protocol in renal transplant recipients . Recipients > 1 year post-transplantation , aged 18 to 70 with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min will be randomly allocated to blinded or unblinded screening arms , before being screened for the presence of antibodies . In the unblinded arm , test results will be revealed . Those with antibodies will have biomarker-led care , consisting of a change in their anti-rejection drugs to prednisone , tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil . In the blinded arm , screening results will be double blinded and all recruits will remain on current therapy ( standard care ) . In both arms , those without antibodies will be retested every 8 months for 3 years . The primary outcome is the 3-year kidney failure rate for the antibody-positive recruits , as measured by initiation of long-term dialysis or re-transplantation , predicted to be approximately 20 % in the standard care group but < 10 % in biomarker-led care . The secondary outcomes include the rate of transplant dysfunction , incidence of infection , cancer and diabetes mellitus , an analysis of adherence with medication and a health economic analysis of the combined screening and treatment protocol . Blood samples will be collected and stored every 4 months and will form the basis of separately funded studies to identify new biomarkers associated with the outcomes . We have evidence that the biomarker-led care regime will be effective at preventing graft dysfunction and expect this to feed through to graft survival . This trial will confirm the benefit of routine screening and lead to a greater understanding of how to keep kidney transplants working longer . Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN46157828 . \" \n",

Women with breast cancer suffer from various treatment side-effects , from psychological and social symptoms as well as decreased quality of life , creating a need for support that may persist throughout the breast cancer experience . This six-month longitudinal study involved a sample of 164 women , who were quasi-randomized between intervention ( n = 85 ) and control groups ( n = 79 ) after breast cancer surgery . Intervention group received support and education via telephone one week after the breast cancer surgery and face-to-face support six months after the surgery . Quality of life was estimated one week and six months after breast cancer surgery , using the Quality of Life Index-Cancer Version ( QLI-CV ) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-BR23 ) . Data were analysed statistically using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests . Factors predicting negative changes in quality of life within six months were investigated using logistic regression models with the enter method . Significant group difference in the magnitude of changes within six months was found in future outlook . Logistic regression analyses revealed six significant predictors of negative changes in quality of life within six months : education , employment status , having underaged children , chemotherapy , radiotherapy and hormonal therapy . The results of this study underline the importance of identifying quality of life changes in patients with breast cancer and paying attention to those women with difficulties in adapting to being a cancer survivor . The findings of this study provide evidence which may help to create appropriate supportive interventions for both acute and long-term settings . \" \n",

An objective of this study is to investigate whether a stronger acid suppressant ( i.e. , PPI ) more effectively prevents bleeding after the recent advanced technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) for EGC . This was a prospective randomized controlled trial performed in a referral cancer center . A total of 143 patients with EGC who underwent ESD were randomly assigned to the treatment groups . They received either rabeprazole 20 mg ( PPI group ) or cimetidine 800 mg ( H2RA group ) on the day before ESD and continued for 8 wk . The primary end point was the incidence of bleeding that was defined as hematemesis or melena that required endoscopic hemostasis and decreased the hemoglobin count by more than 2 g/dL . In baseline data , the endoscopists who performed the ESD were significantly different between the groups . Finally , 66 of 73 patients in the PPI group and 64 of 70 in the H2RA group were analyzed . Bleeding occurred in four patients in the PPI group and 11 in the H2RA group ( P = 0.057 ) . Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment with the PPI significantly reduced the risk of bleeding : adjusted hazard ratio 0.47 , 95 % confidence interval 0.22-0 .92 , P = 0.028 . One delayed perforation was experienced in the H2RA group . PPI therapy more effectively prevented delayed bleeding from the ulcer created after ESD than did H2RA treatment . \" \n",

The following interventions were chosen to address evidence gaps in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Guide to Community Preventive Services : one-on-one education , group education , and reducing out-of-pocket costs ., Three hundred sixty-nine African-American men and women aged > or = 50 years were enrolled in this randomized , controlled community intervention trial . The main outcome measures were postintervention increase in CRC knowledge and obtaining a screening test within 6 months . There was substantial attrition : Two hundred fifty-seven participants completed the intervention and were available for follow-up 3 months to 6 months later . Among completers , there were significant increases in knowledge in both educational cohorts but in neither of the other 2 cohorts . By the 6-month follow-up , 17.7 % ( 11 of 62 participants ) of the Control cohort reported having undergone screening compared with 33.9 % ( 22 of 65 participants ) of the Group Education cohort ( P = .039 ) . Screening rate increases in the other 2 cohorts were not statistically significant . The current results indicated that group education could increase CRC cancer screening rates among African Americans . The screening rate of < 35 % in a group of individuals who participated in an educational program through multiple sessions over a period of several weeks indicated that there still are barriers to overcome . \" \n",

No significant difference in overall survival was detected . Beta2-Microglobulin mutations were identified in 10 ( 29.4 % ) out of 34 MSI-H colon cancers and were associated with a complete absence of disease relapse or tumour-related death events ( P = 0.09 ) . The risk of late disease relapse was significantly lower in patients with MSI-H compared with MSS colon cancer .

CRCS adherence and race were obtained through surveys and supplemented with administrative data . Logistic regressions estimated the contribution of demographic , health , cognitive , and environmental factors to racial disparities in adherence to CRCS guidelines . In unadjusted analyses , Blacks had slightly lower rates of adherence to CRCS guidelines than Whites ( 72 % versus 77 % , p < 0.05 ) . This racial disparity in CRCS adherence was explained by race differences in demographic , health , and environmental factors but not by cognitive factors . Tests for interactions revealed that the association of race with adherence varied significantly across levels of income , education , and marital status . In particular , among those who were married with higher levels of education , CRCS adherence was significantly higher for Whites ; whereas among those who were unmarried , with low levels of education , adherence was significantly higher for Blacks . We found that disparities in CRCS are greatly attenuated in the VA system and both Whites and Blacks have substantially higher rates of CRCS than the national average . These results point to the success of the VA at implementing CRCS system-wide . Our findings also suggest additional initiatives may be needed for unmarried low income white men and higher income black men . \" \n",

Closing the dead space gave a good result for many previous retrospective studies but limited number of randomized control study . To reduce postoperative seroma by closing the axillary space as a randomized control study and to evaluate the incidence of seroma formation at the axilla as a prospective randomized control trial in axillary space closure by suturing a skin flap to the underlying chest wall after MRM . Total consecutive 16 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer at Rajavithi Hospital by pathologic examination from May 2005 to May 2006 and signed informed consent was obtained in the present study . All patients were randomized after mastectomy before wound closure into the control group or study group . In the control group , the wound was closed conventionally . In the study group , axillary space was closed by suturing the skin flap to the underlying muscle , 3 points at mid axillary line . Patients characteristics and operative related factors were recorded and compared between the two groups ., All patients received ultrasonographic examination at axilla two weeks after discharge . There were eight patients in the control group and eight patients in the study group . The patients characteristic and tumor characteristics were recorded and compared ., There was no statistical significance of BMI , tumor size , and hormonal status between the two groups . In the study group , the patients age was significantly higher There was no statistical significance of seroma thickness at the axilla between control group and study group ( 1.77 + / - 1.00 vs. 1.00 + / - 0.22 , p = 0.067 ) . There was no statistically significant difference of seroma thickness at the axilla between the two groups . Further study with a larger sample size is required . \" \n",

This study compared medium - to long-term outcomes of a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open colonic resection for cancer . The case notes of patients included in the LAFA study ( perioperative strategy in colonic surgery ; LAparoscopy and/or FAst track multimodal management versus standard care ) were reviewed 2-5years after randomization for incisional hernia , adhesional small bowel obstruction ( SBO ) , overall survival , cancer recurrence and quality of life ( QoL ) . The laparoscopic and open groups were compared irrespective of fast-track or standard perioperative care . Data on incisional hernias , SBO , survival and recurrence were available for 399 of 400 patients : 208 laparoscopic and 191 open resections . These outcomes were corrected for duration of follow-up . Median follow-up was 34 ( i.q.r. 26-44 ) years . Multivariable regression analysis showed that open resection was a risk factor for incisional hernia ( odds ratio ( OR ) 244 , 95 per cent confidence interval ( c.i. ) 112 to 526 ; P = 0022 ) and SBO ( OR 370 , 107 to 1250 ; P = 0039 ) . There were no differences in overall survival ( hazard ratio 110 , 95 per cent c.i. 067 to 180 ; P = 0730 ) or in cumulative incidence of recurrence ( P = 0514 ) between the laparoscopic and open groups . There were no measured differences in QoL in 281 respondents ( P > 0350 for all scales ) . Laparoscopic colonic surgery led to fewer incisional hernia and adhesional SBO events .

The Cox proportion hazards regression model was used to quantify the relationship between treatment and the outcomes adjusted by the covariates ( age , sex , Breslow depth , tumor site , baseline Profile of Mood States Total Mood Disturbance , baseline active-behavioral coping , baseline natural killer cell activity , and treatment  ie , group intervention  ) . The stepwise procedure was used for covariate selection . For control patients , there was a trend for recurrence ( 13/34 ) and a statistically significant greater rate of death ( 10/34 ) than for experimental patients ( 7/34 and 3/34 , respectively ) . We found that being male and having a greater Breslow depth predicted greater recurrence and poorer survival . Analysis of multiple covariates found that only Breslow depth and treatment ( ie , group intervention ) were significant . Adjusting for Breslow depth , treatment effect remained significant . Finally , baseline affective distress and baseline coping were significant psychobehavioral predictors for recurrence and survival . Surprisingly , higher levels of baseline distress as well as baseline coping and enhancement of active-behavioral coping over time were predictive of lower rates of recurrence and death . Psychiatric interventions that enhance effective coping and reduce affective distress appear to have beneficial effects on survival but are not proposed as an alternative or independent treatment for cancer or any other illness or disease .

Amongst the more effective treatments for relief of dysphagia is insertion of a self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) . It is possible that the addition of a palliative dose of external beam radiotherapy may prolong the relief of dysphagia and provide additional survival benefit . The ROCS trial will assess the effect of adding palliative radiotherapy after esophageal stent insertion . The study is a randomized multicenter phase III trial , with an internal pilot phase , comparing stent alone versus stent plus palliative radiotherapy in patients with incurable esophageal cancer . Eligible participants are those with advanced esophageal cancer who are in need of stent insertion for primary management of dysphagia . Radiotherapy will be administered as 20 Gray ( Gy ) in five fractions over one week or 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks , within four weeks of stent insertion . The internal pilot will assess rates and methods of recruitment ; pre-agreed criteria will determine progression to the main trial . In total , 496 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio with follow up until death . The primary outcome is time to progression of patient-reported dysphagia . Secondary outcomes include survival , toxicity , health resource utilization , and quality of life . An embedded qualitative study will explore the feasibility of patient recruitment by examining patients motivations for involvement and their experiences of consent and recruitment , including reasons for not consenting ., It will also explore patients experiences of each trial arm ., The ROCS study will be a challenging trial studying palliation in patients with a poor prognosis .

Ten patients who underwent a low anterior resection with a deviating double-loop stoma for rectal cancer received an intraperitoneal parastomal mesh at the time of stoma formation . At stoma reversal , laparoscopy was performed and adhesions were scored . After reversal , the mesh defect was closed . Mesh and stoma complications were closely monitored . Incisional herniation was assessed at the 2-year follow-up after stoma reversal using ultrasonography . No infections occurred after mesh placement . After a median of 6 months , stomas were reversed . Laparoscopy could be performed in seven patients ; all patients had adhesions ( median of 25 % of mesh surface ) . In three patients , the bowel was involved ; one required a laparotomy for bowel mobilization during stoma reversal . No adhesion-related morbidity was noted at any time . Except for one superficial wound infection after stoma reversal , no infectious complications were observed . After a median follow-up of 26 months , no incisional herniations were demonstrated .

The performance characteristics of ERP to diagnose AIP were determined . The study was done in two phases . In phase I , 21 physicians from four centres in Asia , Europe and the USA , unaware of the clinical data or diagnoses , reviewed 40 preselected ERPs of patients with AIP ( n = 20 ) , chronic pancreatitis ( n = 10 ) and pancreatic cancer ( n = 10 ) . Physicians noted the presence or absence of key pancreatographic features and ranked the diagnostic possibilities . For phase II , a teaching module was created based on features found most useful in the diagnosis of AIP by the four best performing physicians in phase I. After a washout period of 3 months , all physicians reviewed the teaching module and reanalysed the same set of ERPs , unaware of their performance in phase I. In phase I the sensitivity , specificity and interobserver agreement of ERP alone to diagnose AIP were 44 , 92 and 0.23 , respectively . The four key features of AIP identified in phase I were ( i ) long ( > 1/3 the length of the pancreatic duct ) stricture ; ( ii ) lack of upstream dilatation from the stricture ( < 5 mm ) ; ( iii ) multiple strictures ; and ( iv ) side branches arising from a strictured segment . In phase II the sensitivity ( 71 % ) of ERP significantly improved ( p < 0.05 ) without a significant decline in specificity ( 83 % ) ( p > 0.05 ) ; the interobserver agreement was fair ( 0.40 ) . The ability to diagnose AIP based on ERP features alone is limited but can be improved with knowledge of some key features . \" \n",

We did a randomized , double-blind , placebocontrolled trial of oral ormeloxifene 30 mg , a selective oestrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) or placebo twice a week for 3 months in 20-50-year-old women with breast pain with or without lumpiness . Women with a discrete benign lump or cancer were excluded from the study . Serial assessments of pain on a visual analogue scale and nodularity grade on a 5-point ordinal Lucknow-Cardiff scale were done . A total of 151 patients were randomly allocated to two interventions using a block size of 4 . Of the 151 patients , 121 ( active 57 , placebo 64 ) were available for efficacy analysis . The mean pain level showed a systematic downward trend over five visits ( F = 105.23 , p < 0.0001 ) that significantly reduced in the active group compared to that in the placebo group ( F = 18.66 , p < 0.0001 ) . The patterns of variation in pain over time for the individual groups differ from the overall mean pattern for the two groups and thus from one another ( F = 44.43 , p < 0.0001 ) . Cumulative frequencies of breast nodularity grades during successive visits showed significant improvement ( p = 0.001 ) compared to placebo at the end of the third month . The effect of the active drug persisted till the completion ( 6 months ) of treatment ( p < 0.001 ) . At the last visit , 93.3 % of women in the active group had grade 2 or lower nodularity as compared to 71.1 % in the placebo group . Oligomenorrhoea alone was reported by 12 patients . Ormeloxifene showed significant efficacy for treating breast pain and nodularity . \" \n",

In a randomised phase 2 study in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , adding vandetanib 100 mg to docetaxel significantly improved progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with docetaxel alone , including a longer PFS in women . These results supported investigation of the combination in this larger , definitive phase 3 trial ( ZODIAC ) . Between May , 2006 , and April , 2008 , patients with locally advanced or metastatic ( stage IIIB-IV ) NSCLC after progression following first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 through a third-party interactive voice system to receive vandetanib ( 100 mg/day ) plus docetaxel ( 75 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously every 21 days ; maximum six cycles ) or placebo plus docetaxel . The primary objective was comparison of PFS between the two groups in the intention-to-treat population . Women were a coprimary analysis population . This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00312377 . 1391 patients received vandetanib plus docetaxel ( n = 694  197 women  ) or placebo plus docetaxel ( n = 697  224 women  ) . Vandetanib plus docetaxel led to a significant improvement in PFS versus placebo plus docetaxel ( hazard ratio  HR  0.79 , 97.58 % CI 0.70-0 .90 ; p < 0.0001 ) ; median PFS was 4.0 months in the vandetanib group versus 3.2 months in placebo group . A similar improvement in PFS with vandetanib plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel was seen in women ( HR 0.79 , 0.62-1 .00 , p = 0.024 ) ; median PFS was 4.6 months in the vandetanib group versus 4.2 months in the placebo group . Among grade 3 or higher adverse events , rash ( 63/689  9 %  vs 7/690  1 %  ) , neutropenia ( 199/689  29 %  vs 164/690  24 %  ) , leukopenia ( 99/689  14 %  vs 77/690  11 %  ) , and febrile neutropenia ( 61/689  9 %  vs 48/690  7 %  ) were more common with vandetanib plus docetaxel than with placebo plus docetaxel . The most common serious adverse event was febrile neutropenia ( 46/689  7 %  in the vandetanib group vs 38/690  6 %  in the placebo group ) . The addition of vandetanib to docetaxel provides a significant improvement in PFS in patients with advanced NSCLC after progression following first-line therapy . \" \n",

SELECT terminated after median of 5.5 years of exposure to supplements due to a futility analysis . Both trials then converted into an exposure study . In the randomized component PREADViSE enrolled 7,547 men age 62 or older ( 60 if African American ) . Once the trial terminated 4,246 of these men volunteered for the exposure study . Demographics were similar for both groups with exposure volunteers having baseline mean age 67.3 5.2 years , 15.3 2.4 years of education , 9.8 % African Americans , and 22.0 % reporting a family history of dementia . In the RCT men were randomly assigned to either daily doses of 400 IU of vitamin E or placebo and 200 g of selenium or placebo using a 2x2 factorial structure . In the RCT , participants completed the memory impairment screen ( MIS ) , and if they failed , underwent a longer screening ( based on an expanded Consortium to Establish a Registry in AD  CERAD  battery ) . CERAD failure resulted in visits to their clinician for medical examination with records of these examinations forwarded to the PREADViSE center for further review . In the exposure study , men are contacted by telephone and complete the telephone version of the memory impairment screen ( MIS-T ) screen . If they fail the MIS-T , a modified telephone interview of cognitive status ( TICS-M ) exam is given . A failed TICS-M exam also leads to a visit to their clinician for an in-depth examination and forwarding of records for a centralized consensus diagnosis by expert clinicians . A subgroup of the men who pass the MIS-T also take the TICS-M exam for validation purposes . While this ancillary trial was open to all 427 SELECT clinical sites , only 130 ( 30.0 % ) of the sites chose to participate in PREADViSE . Staff turnover at the sites presented challenges when training persons unfamiliar with cognitive testing procedures to conduct the memory screens . In the RCT few participants ( 1.6 % ) failed the MIS screen and among those who passed this screen a significant practice effect was encountered . In the exposure study 3,581 men were reached by phone in year 1 , 15.7 % could not be reached after 5 calls , and of those contacted 6.0 % refused the screen even after consenting to the procedures at their clinical site . Most notable is that the failure rate for the MIS-T increased fourfold to 7.2 % . Of the 257 men who took the TICS-M , 84.0 % failed and were asked to contact their physicians for a more detailed memory assessment , and approximately half of these had some form of dementia or cognitive impairment . Several of these dementia cases are not AD . Partnering with SELECT led to an AD prevention trial conducted at a very reasonable cost by taking advantage of the experience and efficient clinical trial management found in a cancer cooperative group ( Southwest Oncology Group or SWOG ) . Once unblinded , the RCT and exposure study data have the potential to yield new information on long term exposure to antioxidant supplements under controlled conditions . \" \n",

New surgical devices , such as dissectors and hemostatic scalpels , allow precise definition of the surgical field with finer dissection of the anatomic structures , with subsequent reductions in operative times and better oncologic and functional outcomes . Although monopolar scissors ( MS ) are still widely used , radiofrequency ( RF ) and ultrasound ( US ) scalpels have been introduced recently in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP ) . Despite the widespread use of these scalpels , however , few studies have compared these devices in terms of oncologic and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy . The present study aimed to prospectively assess the impact of MS , RF , and US scalpels on margin status at apex , and recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients undergoing extraperitoneal LRP . A total of 150 men were prospectively enrolled between September 2009 and April 2013 and postoperatively evaluated for continence and clinical factors . There were no differences in terms of operative times ( P = 0.9433 ) , blood loss ( P = 0.9681 ) , apical margin positivity ( P = 0.3965 ) or postoperative hospital stay ( P = 0.9257 ) among the groups . Moreover , no differences in the functional outcome scores , as evaluated by the International Consultation on Incontinence self-administered Questionnaire , at 1 , 3 , and 6 months postsurgery were observed . Our study represents the first evaluation of continence recovery in LRP with respect to different devices used for prostatic apex dissection . We found that the oncologic , functional , and operative outcomes were similar between these different devices during LRP , with no scalpel demonstrating superiority in continence recovery . \" \n",

Because temozolomide ( TMZ ) and erlotinib ( ETN ) cross the blood-brain barrier and have documented activity in NSCLC , a phase 3 study was designed to test whether these drugs would improve the OS associated with WBRT + SRS . NSCLC patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases were randomized to receive WBRT ( 2.5 Gy 15 to 37.5 Gy ) and SRS alone , versus WBRT + SRS + TMZ ( 75 mg/m ( 2 ) / day 21 days ) or ETN ( 150 mg/day ) . ETN ( 150 mg/day ) or TMZ ( 150-200 mg/m ( 2 ) / day 5 days/month ) could be continued for as long as 6 months after WBRT + SRS . The primary endpoint was OS . After 126 patients were enrolled , the study closed because of accrual limitations . The median survival times ( MST ) for WBRT + SRS , WBRT + SRS + TMZ , and WBRT + SRS + ETN were qualitatively different ( 13.4 , 6.3 , and 6.1 months , respectively ) , although the differences were not statistically significant . Time to central nervous system progression and performance status at 6 months were better in the WBRT + SRS arm . Grade 3 to 5 toxicity was 11 % , 41 % , and 49 % in arms 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ( P < .001 ) . The addition of TMZ or ETN to WBRT + SRS in NSCLC patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases did not improve survival and possibly had a deleterious effect . Because the analysis is underpowered , these data suggest but do not prove that increased toxicity was the cause of inferior survival in the drug arms . \" \n",

Compared with the Doc/Carb group , fewer patients in the Pem/Carb group experienced grade 3/4 drug-related , treatment-emergent neutropenia , leukopenia , or febrile neutropenia , and more patients experienced anemia and thrombocytopenia . There were three study drug-related deaths during treatment in each group .

Patients received intravesical HAL for 1 hour and were assessed with standard white light cystoscopy and blue light fluorescence cystoscopy . All lesions were mapped onto a bladder chart and biopsies were taken from suspicious areas for assessment by an independent pathologist . An independent urologist blinded to the detection method used recommended treatment plans based on biopsy results and medical history according to European Association of Urology bladder cancer guidelines . Any differences in recommended treatment plans arising from the 2 cystoscopy methods were recorded . HAL imaging improved overall tumor detection . Of all tumors 96 % were detected with HAL imaging compared with 77 % using standard cystoscopy . This difference was particularly noticeable for dysplasia ( 93 % vs 48 % ) , carcinoma in situ ( 95 % vs 68 % ) and superficial papillary tumors ( 96 % vs 85 % ) . As a result of improved detection , additional postoperative procedures were recommended in 15 patients ( 10 % ) and more extensive treatment was done intraoperatively in a further 10 . Overall 17 % of patients received more appropriate treatment at the time of the study following blue light fluorescence cystoscopy , that is 22 % or 1 of 5 if patients without tumors were excluded . HAL imaging is more effective than standard white light cystoscopy for detecting bladder tumors and lesions .

Evaluative parameters were : histologic grade , clinical size , and LOH . Topical application of the BRB gel to OIN lesions resulted in statistically significant reductions in lesional sizes , histologic grades , and LOH events . In contrast , placebo gel lesions demonstrated a significant increase in lesional size and no significant effects on histologic grade or LOH events . Collectively , these data strongly support BRB s chemopreventive impact ., A cohort of very BRB-responsive patients , as demonstrated by high therapeutic efficacy , was identified . Corresponding protein profiling studies , which demonstrated higher pretreatment levels of BRB metabolic and keratinocyte differentiation enzymes in BRB-responsive lesions , reinforce the importance of local metabolism and differentiation competency .

A total of 356 patients in the United Kingdom completed the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist ( RSCL ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) at 10 time points . The principal aim of the analyses was to keep the methods simple , so as to allow the presentation and interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible . This was achieved by ( 1 ) considering individual symptoms rather than symptom subscales or domains , ( 2 ) assessing short-term effects ( up to 3 months ) and long-term effects ( at 1 and 2 years ) separately , and ( 3 ) for the short-term analyses , ( a ) splitting the data randomly into an exploratory data set and a confirmatory data set , and ( b ) using two different methods of analysis : a subject-specific approach , which used the area under the curve ( AUC ) as a summary measure , and a group-based method , which plotted the percent of patients with moderate or severe symptoms over time .

Participant siblings ( N = 412 ) who were not up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening were randomly assigned to receive either a generic print pamphlet , a tailored print pamphlet , or a tailored print pamphlet and tailored counseling call . Colorectal cancer screening 6 months after the baseline interview was the outcome measure . Results indicated that colorectal cancer screening adherence increased among intermediate risk siblings enrolled in all three intervention groups . Participants in both tailored intervention groups reported having colorectal cancer screening at significantly higher rates than participants in the generic print group . The increase in colorectal cancer screening in the tailored print and counseling call group was not significantly higher than that achieved by the tailored print alone . Decisional balance partially mediated treatment effects . Tailored behavioral interventions are effective methods for increasing screening adherence but telephone counseling did not add significantly to treatment effects . \" \n",

A phase III , randomized , placebo , controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of flaxseed in reducing hot flashes . Postmenopausal women with or without breast cancer were randomly assigned to a flaxseed bar ( providing 410 mg of lignans ) for 6 weeks versus a placebo bar . Participants completed daily , prospective , hot flash diaries during the baseline week , and then ate one study bar per day for 6 weeks while recording their daily hot flashes . The intraparticipant difference in hot flash activity between baseline and the last treatment week was the primary endpoint . Adverse effects were evaluated through a self-report and the Common Terminology Criteria assessment . A total of 188 women were enrolled in this trial . The mean hot flash score was reduced 4.9 in the flaxseed group and 3.5 in the placebo group ( P = 0.29 ) . In both groups , slightly more than a third of the women received a 50 % reduction in their hot flash score . Only one adverse effect was significantly different between groups , grade 1 pruritus , which was more common in the placebo group ( 8 % vs 1 % ) . Both groups reported abdominal distension , flatulence , diarrhea , and nausea . Adherence and ability to detect treatment assignment did not differ between groups . The results of this trial do not support the use of 410 mg of lignans for the reduction of hot flashes . The bars were fairly well tolerated , with both groups reporting gastrointestinal effects , probably due to the fiber content . \" \n",

Pamidronate in 30 - , 60 - , or 90-mg doses was administered as a single 24-hour infusion . Serum calcium corrected for albumin , urine hydroxyproline , and calcium excretion , and serum parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) ( 1-84 ) were determined before and after pamidronate therapy . Thirty-two men and 18 women entered the study . A dose-response relationship for normalization of corrected serum calcium was seen after pamidronate administration . Corrected serum calcium normalized in 40 % of patients who received 30 mg , in 61 % of patients who received 60 mg , and in 100 % of patients who received 90 mg of pamidronate . The decline in the serum calcium level was associated with decreased osteoclastic skeletal resorption evidenced by a decrease in urine calcium and hydroxyproline excretion . Among those with a normalized corrected serum calcium level , the mean ( median ) duration of normalization of the corrected serum calcium value was 9.2 ( 4 ) , 13.3 ( 5 ) , and 10.8 ( 6 ) days in the 30 - , 60 - , and 90-mg treatment groups , respectively . The response of hypercalcemia to pamidronate was not significantly influenced by the presence of skeletal metastases . PTH 1-84 , suppressed in patients on entry into this study , increased to a greater extent in those patients with osteolytic skeletal metastases compared with those with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy . Clinical improvement , including improved mental status and decreased anorexia , accompanied the decline in the corrected serum calcium level in all three treatment groups . Side effects included low-grade fever , asymptomatic hypocalcemia , hypomagnesemia , and hypophosphatemia . A single-dose infusion of 60 to 90 mg of pamidronate was highly effective and well tolerated and normalized corrected serum calcium in nearly all patients ( 61 % to 100 % ) with hypercalcemia of malignancy . \" \n",

Eligible patients ( n = 2306 ) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups following surgery . A total of 771 patients with follow-up data received tamoxifen alone ; 767 received methotrexate , fluorouracil , and tamoxifen ( MFT ) ; and 768 received cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , fluorouracil , and tamoxifen ( CMFT ) . The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate disease-free survival , distant disease-free survival , and survival . Reported P values are two-sided . Through 5 years of follow-up , chemotherapy plus tamoxifen resulted in significantly better disease-free survival than tamoxifen alone ( 90 % for MFT versus 85 % for tamoxifen  P = .01  ; 89 % for CMFT versus 85 % for tamoxifen  P = .001  ) . A similar benefit was observed in both distant disease-free survival ( 92 % for MFT versus 87 % for tamoxifen  P = .008  ; 91 % for CMFT versus 87 % for tamoxifen  P = .006  ) and survival ( 97 % for MFT versus 94 % for tamoxifen  P = .05  ; 96 % for CMFT versus 94 % for tamoxifen  P = .03  ) . Compared with tamoxifen alone , MFT and CMFT reduced the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and the risk of recurrence at other local , regional , and distant sites . Risk of treatment failure was reduced after both types of chemotherapy , regardless of tumor size , tumor estrogen or progesterone receptor level , or patient age ; however , the reduction was greatest in patients aged 49 years or less . No subgroup of patients evaluated in this study failed to benefit from chemotherapy . Findings from this and other NSABP studies indicate that patients with breast cancer who meet NSABP protocol criteria , regardless of age , lymph node status , tumor size , or estrogen receptor status , are candidates for chemotherapy . \" \n",

Similar effects were observed for those with partners who were motivated to implement the intervention , and for those with partners high in ability to provide support . Study limitations include the need to evaluate whether the effects can be sustained long term and the exclusion of patients with melanoma without partners .

To resolve this issue , we conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the effects of supine and prone positioning on organ motion , positioning errors , and dose to critical organs during escalated dose conformal irradiation for localized prostate cancer and patient and therapist satisfaction with setup technique . Twenty eight patients were randomized to commence treatment immobilized in the supine or prone position and were subsequently changed to the alternate positioning for the latter half of their treatment . Patients underwent CT simulation and conformal radiotherapy planning and treatment in both positions . The clinical target volume encompassed the prostate gland . Alternate day lateral port films were compared to corresponding simulator radiographs to measure the isocentre positioning errors ( IPE ) . Prostate motion ( PM ) and total positioning error ( TPE ) were measured from the same films by the displacements of three implanted fiducial markers . Dose volume histograms ( DVHs ) for the two treatment positions were compared at the 95 , 80 and 50 % dose ( D % ) levels . The patients and radiation therapists completed weekly questionnaires regarding patient comfort and ease of setup . Seven patients , who started in the supine position , subsequently refused prone position and received their whole treatment supine . Small bowel in the treatment volume , not present in the supine position , prevented one patient from being treated prone . PM in anterior posterior direction was statistically significantly less in the supine position ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no significant difference in superior inferior PM for the two treatment positions . No statistically significant difference between supine and prone positioning was observed in isocentre positioning error ( IPE ) or total positioning error ( TPE ) due to a policy of daily pre-treatment correction . However , more pre-treatment corrections were required for patients in the prone position . The DVH analysis demonstrated larger volumes of the bladder wall , rectal wall and small bowel within the D95 , D80 and D50 % when comparing the planning target volumes ( PTVs ) actually treated for prone positioning . When the prone PTV was expanded to account for the greater PM encountered in that position , a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.007 ) was observed in favour of the supine position at all dose levels . In the prone position , four patients had small bowel within the 60 Gray ( Gy ) isodose and in the supine position , no patients had small bowel in the 60 or 38Gy volumes . Supine position was significantly more comfortable for the patients and setup was significantly easier for the radiation therapists . The median patient comfort score was 0.79 ( Standard deviation ( SD ) 0.03 ) supine and 0.45 ( SD 0.05 ) prone ( P < 0.001 ) The therapist convenience of setup was 0.80 ( SD 0.016 ) supine and 0.54 ( SD 0.025 ) prone ( P < 0.005 ) . No statistically significant difference was seen for the other parameters studied . We demonstrated significantly less PM in the supine treatment position . There was no difference for either treatment position in IPE or TPE , however , more pre-treatment corrections were required in the prone position . Prone position required a larger PTV with resulting increased dose to critical organs . There were statistically significant improvements at all dose levels for small bowel , rectal wall and bladder wall doses in the supine position once corrections were made for differences in organ motion . Linear analogue scores of patient comfort and radiation therapist convenience demonstrated statistically significant improvement in favour of the supine position .

However , the prognostic role of complete and so-called optimal and suboptimal debulking and its interaction with biological factors has not been not fully defined . Exploratory analysis was conducted of 3 prospective randomized trials ( AGO-OVAR 3 , 5 , and 7 ) investigating platinum-taxane based chemotherapy regimens in advanced ovarian cancer conducted between 1995 and 2002 . A total of 3126 patients were analyzed . Approximately one-third each fulfilled criteria for complete resection ( group A ) , small residual tumor burden of 1-10 mm ( group B ) , or macroscopic residual disease exceeding 1 cm in diameter ( group C ) . Multivariate analysis showed improved progression-free and overall survival for group A with complete resection compared with groups B or C ( P < .0001 ) . The impact of so-called optimal debulking as in group B showed a smaller prognostic impact compared with group C. Further independent prognostic factors for overall survival were age , performance status , grade , FIGO stage , and histology , namely the mucinous subtype . An interaction between residual tumor and some biologic factors was demonstrated . The goal of primary surgery should be complete resection . The prognostic impact of tumor biology seemed to be partially overruled by residual tumor and further evaluation of biologic factors should stratify for residual tumor . \" \n",

Other main eligibility criteria were age < 75 years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status = 0 to 2 . The study design was as follows : all patients received whole-brain radiotherapy in three split courses of 18 gy/10 fractions . They were randomly ( 1:1 ) assigned to regimen A , consisting of a triplet cisplatin-vinorelbine-ifosfomide , or to regimen B , consisting of high-dose single-drug ifosfamide . In both groups , chemotherapy was delivered on a 4-week cycle , for three courses . Each course was delivered concurrently with radiotherapy . Brain and other tumor lesion assessments were performed in both groups at the end of the three courses ( RECIST ) . Neurologic symptoms were evaluated quantitatively at each step of the treatment program . All analyses were carried out in an intention to treat basis , and statistical tests were two sided . Seventy patients were randomly allocated into groups A ( n = 37 ) and B ( n = 33 ) . With regards to the whole lesions , overall response rates did not significantly differ between the groups ( group A : 45.9 % ; group B : 33.3 % ; chi ( 2 ) ; p = 0.28 ) . When brain-target lesions were separately analyzed , respective response rates were 59.5 % and 48.5 % ; ( chi ( 2 ) ; p = 0.0.53 ) . Febrile neutropenia was more frequently observed in the former group ( n = 19 , 54.29 % ) than in the latter ( n = 12 , 36.36 % ; p = 0.13 ) , and a similar difference was also observed regarding documented infections . Red blood cell transfusions and readmission for antibiotic infusions significantly affected more patients in group A than in group B. The longitudinal evaluation of neurologic symptoms ( by means of Generalized Estimating Equation ) slightly improved during the treatment program , and there was no difference between the groups .

The primary objective was response rate in patients with methylated hMLH1 tumour DNA in plasma . After a pre-defined interim analysis , the study closed due to lack of efficacy and poor treatment deliverability in 15 patients treated with the combination . Responses by GCIG criteria were 9 out of 14 vs 3 out of 15 and by RECIST were 6 out of 13 vs 1 out of 12 for carboplatin and carboplatin/decitabine , respectively .

For the majority of CVD risk factors , similar proportions of patients and controls ( 35-60 % ) were classified as `` undesirable . , A significantly higher proportion of patients were classified with low cardiorespiratory fitness ( 46 % versus 0 % , P < 0.01 ) , being overweight/obese ( 72 % versus 50 % , P < 0.05 ) , and having resting sinus tachycardia ( 50 % versus 0 % , P < 0.01 ) compared with controls . Cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass index were correlated with CVD risk factors ( r = -0.64 to 0.63 , P < 0.05 ; r = -0.63 to 0.67 , P < 0.05 , respectively ) . Exploratory analyses revealed several differences between CVD risk factors based on chemotherapy regimen . Breast cancer survivors treated with adjuvant chemotherapy are at a higher risk of developing late-occurring CVD than age-matched controls due to direct and indirect treatment-related toxicity . \" \n",

Changes in QoL over time of 10 points were considered clinically relevant . Repeated-measures regression analyses were applied to estimate and test the QoL changes over time , the differences between the two arms , and for association with a number of covariates . At 3-year follow-up , the summary score physical health was 73.2 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 71.6 for the 78-Gy arm ( p = 0.81 ) , and the summary score mental health was 76.7 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 76.1 for the 78-Gy arm ( p = 0.97 ) . Statistically significant ( p < 0.01 ) deterioration in QoL scores over time was registered in both arms in six scales . The deterioration over time was more pronounced in the high-dose arm for most scales . However , clinically relevant deterioration ( > 10 points ) was seen for only two scales . None of the tested covariates were significantly correlated with QoL scores . Dose escalation did not result in significant deterioration of QoL in prostate cancer patients . In both randomization arms , statistically significant decreases in QoL scores over time were seen in six scales . The deterioration of QoL was more pronounced in the physical than in the mental health domain and in some scales more in the high - than in the low-dose arm , but the differences between arms were not statistically significant . \" \n",

Lymphorrea is a serious and disabling complication of axillary lymphadenectomy , but no effective therapy is currently available . Octreotide is a hormone with general antisecretory effects that has been used to control lymphorrhea in thoracic duct injury and after radical neck dissection . The aim of the study we describe in this article was to determine whether octreotide has a role in the treatment of post axillary lymphadenectomy lymphorrhea . This is a prospective randomized controlled trial . Two hundred sixty-one consecutive patients with various stages of breast cancer who underwent axillary lymph node dissection were randomized and followed for 7 years . The treatment group received 0.1 mg octreotide subcutaneously three times a day for 5 days , starting on the first postoperative day , while the control group received no treatment . Of the 261 patients undergoing axillary node dissection , 136 were assigned to the control group and 125 composed the treatment group . The control group and the treatment group were evaluated for amount and duration of lymphorrhea as well as inflammatory and infectious complications . In the control group , the mean quantity ( + / - standard deviation ) of lymphorrhea was 94.6 + / - 19 cc per day and the average duration was 16.7 + / - 3.0 days . In comparison , the mean quantity of lymphorrhea in the treatment group was 65.4 + / - 21.1 cc ( p < 0.0001 ) per day and the average duration was 7.1 + / - 2.9 days ( p < 0.0001 ) . We did not find an important difference in the number of infectious complication or hematomas formation between the study groups . Octreotide can be used successfully for the treatment of post-axillary dissection lymphorrea , and potentially , in the prevention of post-axillary lymph node dissection lymphosarcoma , since the amount and duration of lymphorrhea in this setting are known to be important risk factors for its development . Potentially , octreotide might be used in similar situations where lymphorrhea is detrimental , such as peripheral vascular surgery and regional lymph node dissection for melanoma . \" \n",

Noninvasive monitoring of free flaps with laser Doppler flowmetry may provide further information regarding the local regulation of blood flow in the flap tissues during pressor infusions . This study evaluated the effects of four commonly used pressor agents . Twenty four patients ( 25 data sets ) undergoing head and neck cancer resection and free flap reconstruction were recruited . Epinephrine , norepinephrine , dopexamine , and dobutamine were infused in a random order at four infusion rates , after surgery , with free flap and control area ( deltoid region ) laser Doppler skin blood flow monitoring . Frequency analysis of the Doppler waveform was performed utilizing the time period immediately before the first drug infusion for each patient as baseline . At baseline there was less power at the 0.002-0 .6 Hz frequency in the flap compared with control tissue consistent with surgical denervation . At maximum epinephrine infusion rates , the control of blood flow moved toward ( i.e. , proportion of power increased in ) the lower frequencies , as smooth muscle mediated ( myogenic ) control began to dominate blood flow , an effect most marked with norepinephrine . Dobutamine and dopexamine had little effect on control of blood flow . Denervation of free flap tissue is demonstrable using spectral analysis of laser Doppler blood flow signals . With norepinephrine the control of blood flow shifts toward low frequency vasomotion where blood flow depends mostly on average blood pressure , making it potentially the most suitable agent following free tissue transfer . \" \n",

Aberrant promoter methylation of CAV-1 is associated with inactivation of expression . We previously observed CAV-1 mutations in breast cancers and therefore devised this study to examine the hypermethylation status of the promoter region of CAV-1 with reference to breast cancer progression and development . Hypermethylation status of CAV-1 was analyzed by methylation specific PCR . Loss of expression of the CAV-1 gene was further evaluated by semi-quantitative rt-PCR . 28/130 ( 21.5 % ) breast cancer cases showed promoter hypermethylation with reduced CAV-1 expression levels when compared with adjacent normal breast tissue . CAV-1 gene hypermethylation was significantly related to menopausal status , histopathological grade and age . The rationale of our study is that CAV-1 gene is transcriptionally repressed in breast cancer cells due to hypermethylation . Our results reveal that promoter hypermethylation and loss of expression of the CAV-1 gene is an important alternative mechanism for inactivation of CAV-1 leading to complete gene silencing . \" \n",

To assess the effect of screening for PCa on the incidence of metastatic disease in a randomized trial . Data were available for 76,813 men aged 55-69 yr coming from four centers of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . The presence of metastatic disease was evaluated by imaging or by prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) values > 100 ng/ml at diagnosis and during follow-up . Regular screening based on serum PSA measurements was offered to 36270 men randomized to the screening arm , while no screening was provided to the 40543 men in the control arm . The Nelson-Aalen technique and Poisson regression were used to calculate cumulative incidence and rate ratios of M + disease . After a median follow-up of 12 yr , 666 men with M + PCa were detected , 256 in the screening arm and 410 in the control arm , resulting in cumulative incidence of 0.67 % and 0.86 % per 1000 men , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . This finding translated into a relative reduction of 30 % ( hazard ratio  HR  : 0.70 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.60-0 .82 ; p = 0.001 ) in the intention-to-screen analysis and a 42 % ( p = 0.0001 ) reduction for men who were actually screened . An absolute risk reduction of metastatic disease of 3.1 per 1000 men randomized ( 0.31 % ) was found . A large discrepancy was seen when comparing the rates of M + detected at diagnosis and all M + cases that emerged during the total follow-up period , a 50 % reduction ( HR : 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.41-0 .62 ) versus the 30 % reduction . The main limitation is incomplete explanation of the lack of an effect of screening during follow-up . PSA screening significantly reduces the risk of developing metastatic PCa . However , despite earlier diagnosis with screening , certain men still progress and develop metastases . The ERSPC trial is registered under number ISRCTN49127736 . \" \n",

However , there is conflicting clinical evidence as to whether sucralfate , taken prophylactically during radiotherapy , can ameliorate the symptoms of acute radiation proctitis . A double-blind randomized trial was conducted at four Radiation Oncology Departments in Sydney , Australia , between February 1995 and June 1997 . A total of 338 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer receiving small volume radiotherapy , of whom 335 were evaluable , were randomized to receive either 3 g of oral sucralfate suspension or placebo twice a day during radiotherapy . Patients kept a daily record of their bowel symptoms and were graded according to the RTOG/EORTC acute toxicity criteria . One hundred sixty-four patients received sucralfate and 171 received placebo . Both groups were well balanced with regard to patient , tumor , treatment factors , and baseline symptoms , except that the placebo group had a significantly more liquid baseline stool consistency score ( p = 0.004 ) . Patients kept a daily diary of symptoms during radiotherapy . After adjusting for baseline values , there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to stool frequency ( p = 0.41 ) , consistency ( p = 0.20 ) , flatus ( p = 0.25 ) , mucus ( p = 0.54 ) , and pain ( p = 0.73 ) . However , there was more bleeding in the sucralfate group , with 64 % of patients noticing rectal bleeding , compared with 47 % in the placebo group ( p = 0.001 ) .

This study suggests that oral sucralfate taken prophylactically during radiotherapy does not ameliorate the symptoms of acute radiation proctitis and may increase acute bleeding . The cause of the increased bleeding in the sucralfate group is unclear . As the pathogenesis of acute and late reactions are different , late follow-up , which includes sigmoidoscopic evaluation , is currently being performed on this cohort of patients . \" \n",

The major end points of this multicenter , randomized trial were progression-free survival , response rate , and toxicity . Overall survival was a secondary end point . Tumor responses were reviewed by an independent committee . Analysis of the results was performed on an intention-to-treat basis . One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled . There was no difference in toxicity between the arms , and no toxic death was observed . One partial response was observed in arm A and five in arm B. Progression-free survival did not differ between the arms , and rates at 1 year were 12 % and 15 % in arms A and B , respectively . No statistically significant differences were detected in any end point . The subcutaneous combination of rIL-2 and rIFNalpha-2a with or without FU does not benefit patients with metastatic renal carcinoma . Neither of these regimens can be recommended as standard treatment . The results of the subcutaneous cytokine regimen seem disappointing . \" \n",

The median number of cycles was four in each arm with a total of 1268 cycles . The objective response ( OR ) on intent-to-treat was 20.8 % in VC and 28 % in VG ( p = 0.15 ) . Median PFS was 3.9 months in VC and 4.4 months ( mo ) in VG ( p = 0.18 ) . Median survival was significantly longer ( p = 0.01 ) for VG with 11.5 mo compared to 8.6 mo in VC with 1 year survival at 48.9 and 34.4 % , respectively . Tolerance was better in the VG arm as compared to the VC patients . Four toxic deaths were recorded in the VC group . Clinical benefit response rate was 32.4 % compared to 40.9 % in 111 and 110 evaluable patients in VC and VG , respectively . VG compared to VC resulted in a similar overall response rate , favourable median survival and a better toxicity profile . For non-cisplatin-based chemotherapy , VG is a useful alternative . \" \n",

Younger women ( age < 51 years , N = 252 ) with early-stage breast cancer within 2 months of having completed active nonhormonal adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to a three-arm clinical trial , consisting of a control arm , an education arm , and a nutrition arm . Primary end points , assessed before random assignment and 4 and 13 months later , included mental functioning , physical functioning , and depressive symptoms . Four types of moderator variables were identified , including two sets reflecting psychosocial resources , specifically personality factors and factors related to the person s social environment , a set reflecting demographic variables , and a set reflecting treatment and disease variables ( including comorbidities ) ., Psychosocial factors were more likely to moderate treatment effects than were demographic and disease-related factors , but the moderating effects of these psychosocial factors were limited to patients receiving the nutrition intervention . Patients with lower psychosocial resources benefited from the nutrition intervention , whereas patients with a greater amount of psychosocial resources did not . Future trials of this type should stratify by or select for the moderating variables identified here ( ie , dispositional pessimism , unmitigated communion , and negative social interaction ) to establish more firmly their role in responses to psychosocial interventions .

Ninety-nine patients presenting de novo with lung cancer were randomized to receive EBT or XRT . Eleven key symptoms or clinical signs were assessed by clinicians and patient ratings using self-assessment questionnaires were obtained at the same time . The primary endpoints were a comparison of EBT and XRT for symptom relief and acute and late side-effects ( palliation ) and their effect on patients functional status and patient-rated QL outcomes ., A secondary objective was a comparison of clinician assessments with patient self-reported symptoms . Both treatments produced good levels of symptom relief . They were better for XRT at the expense of more acute morbidity . Late side-effects were similar . The functional status of patients was well maintained and changed similarly with time in both groups . XRT gave a better duration of palliation . Twenty-eight percent of XRT patients required EBT ( at a median time of 304 days ) whereas 51 % of EBT patients subsequently had XRT ( at a median of 125 days ) . There was a significant modest gain in median survival with initial XRT ( 287 vs. 250 days ) . When clinician and patient assessments were compared , doctors were found to underestimate the severity of breathlessness , anorexia , tiredness and nausea . Fractionated XRT is preferred to EBT as an initial treatment in better performance patients because it provides better overall and more sustained palliation with fewer retreatments and a modest gain in survival time . QL assessment is required in the evaluation of palliative treatments because clinicians frequently underestimate the incidence and severity of key symptoms . \" \n",

Administration of IL-3 and GM-CSF resulted in more significant toxicity requiring pharmacologic treatment in 90 % of patients . The three cytokine regimens administered after HD-CTX are comparably effective in reducing hematologic toxicity and mobilizing the hematopoietic progenitor cells . G-CSF accelerates leukocyte recovery and progenitor mobilization . Although G-CSF-treated patients have somewhat slower platelet recovery , they definitely have fewer side effects . \" \n",

In this study , we aimed to compare treatment with necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with previously untreated stage IV squamous non-small-cell lung cancer . We did this open-label , randomised phase 3 study at 184 investigative sites in 26 countries . Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV squamous non-small-cell lung cancer , with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 0-2 and adequate organ function and who had not received previous chemotherapy for their disease were eligible for inclusion . Enrolled patients were randomly assigned centrally 1:1 to a maximum of six 3-week cycles of gemcitabine and cisplastin chemotherapy with or without necitumumab according to a block randomisation scheme ( block size of four ) by a telephone-based interactive voice response system or interactive web response system . Chemotherapy was gemcitabine 1250 mg/m ( 2 ) administered intravenously over 30 min on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle and cisplatin 75 mg/m ( 2 ) administered intravenously over 120 min on day 1 of a 3-week cycle . Necitumumab 800 mg , administered intravenously over a minimum of 50 min on days 1 and 8 , was continued after the end of chemotherapy until disease progression or intolerable toxic side-effects occurred . Randomisation was stratified by ECOG performance status and geographical region . Neither physicians nor patients were masked to group assignment because of the expected occurrence of acne-like rash -- a class effect of EGFR antibodies -- that would have unmasked most patients and investigators to treatment . The primary endpoint was overall survival , analysed by intention to treat . We report the final clinical analysis . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00981058 . Between Jan 7 , 2010 , and Feb 22 , 2012 , we enrolled 1093 patients and randomly assigned them to receive necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin ( n = 545 ) or gemcitabine and cisplatin ( n = 548 ) . Overall survival was significantly longer in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin alone group ( median 115 months  95 % CI 104-126  ) vs 99 months  89-111  ; stratified hazard ratio 084  95 % CI 074-096 ; p = 001  ) . In the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group , the number of patients with at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event was higher ( 388  72 %  of 538 patients ) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group ( 333  62 %  of 541 ) , as was the incidence of serious adverse events ( 257  48 %  of 538 patients vs 203  38 %  of 541 ) . More patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group had grade 3-4 hypomagnesaemia ( 47  9 %  of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group vs six  1 %  of 541 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group ) and grade 3 rash ( 20  4 %  vs one  < 1 %  ) . Including events related to disease progression , adverse events with an outcome of death were reported for 66 ( 12 % ) of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group and 57 ( 11 % ) of 541 patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group ; these were deemed to be related to study drugs in 15 ( 3 % ) and ten ( 2 % ) patients , respectively . Overall , we found that the safety profile of necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was acceptable and in line with expectations . Our findings show that the addition of necitumumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and represents a new first-line treatment option for this disease .

Retrospective studies have suggested that such probes might have greater cancer detection rates . The present prospective randomized multicenter trial aimed to compare the prostate cancer detection rates of the end-fire versus side-fire probe configuration during transrectal ultrasound-guided 12-core prostate biopsy . Patients were randomized according to age , prostate-specific antigen level and prostate volume . An interim analysis was planned after the inclusion of 300 patients . At the interim analysis after the inclusion of 297 patients , no differences were found in the mean prostate-specific antigen level ( P = .412 ) , mean age ( P = .519 ) , mean prostate volume ( P = .730 ) , and positive digital rectal examination findings ( P = .295 ) . The prostate cancer detection rate did not differ between the end-fire and side-fire probe ( 34.3 % vs 34.4 % , P = .972 ) . On multivariate analysis , suspicious digital rectal examination findings ( relative risk 8.185 , P < .001 ) , prostate-specific antigen level ( relative risk 1.051 , P = .041 ) , and prostate volume ( relative risk 0.973 , P < .001 ) , but not probe configuration ( relative risk 0.942 , P = .831 ) , were independent predictive factors for the detection of prostate cancer . The interim analysis committee suggested that , because no difference of 5 absolute percent was achieved after 300 patients , no additional recruitment was necessary . Therefore , the study was terminated early . The results of the present study have shown that the transrectal ultrasound probe configuration does not affect the prostate cancer detection rate during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy . \" \n",

During the study period , the incidence of prostate cancer in the placebo and dutasteride groups was 19.6 % ( 11/56 ) and 9.3 % ( 5/54 ) , respectively ( relative risk reduction , 54 % ; 95 % confidence intervals , -27 to 83 % , P = 0.12 ) , in the Asian subpopulation . Fewer tumors with the Gleason scores of 7-10 and 8-10 were detected among dutasteride-treated men . Although the incidences of drug-related sexual adverse events were higher in the dutasteride group , only in rare occasions did they lead to drug discontinuation . The incidence of prostate cancer in the dutasteride group was lower than that in the placebo group , although the difference was not significant . These results paralleled those for the overall population and support the value of dutasteride for prostate cancer risk reduction in Asian men with an increased risk of prostate cancer . \" \n",

In a randomized clinical trial comprising 697 patients with colorectal cancer , the relationship between two types of red cell components ( buffy coat-depleted packed red cells and white cell-reduced  filtered  packed red cells ) and postoperative bacterial infections was analyzed . Both types of red cells appeared to be associated with a greater incidence of postoperative infection than was no transfusion ( 39 vs. 24 % , p < 0.01 ) . A dose-response relationship could be demonstrated : the corrected relative risk was 1.6 for 1 to 3 units of red cells and 3.6 for more than 3 units . Multivariate analyses identified the transfusion of red cells and tumor location as the only significant independent risk factors for postoperative bacterial infection . Because allogeneic white cells , plasma , microaggregates , citrate , and platelets could be ruled out as risk factors for transfusion-associated postoperative infections , it is hypothesized that the transfusion of red cells is a potentially detrimental factor that transiently impairs the clearance of bacteria by phagocytic cells . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" We conducted a randomized trial to compare gemcitabine-cisplatin with etoposide-cisplatin in the treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The primary end point of the comparison was response rate . A total of 135 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 intravenously ( IV ) days 1 and 8 or etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 3 along with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV day 1 . Both treatments were administered in 21-day cycles . One hundred thirty-three patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis of response . The response rate ( externally validated ) for patients given gemcitabine-cisplatin was superior to that for patients given etoposide-cisplatin ( 40.6 % v 21.9 % ; P = .02 ) . This superior response rate was associated with a significant delay in time to disease progression ( 6.9 months v 4.3 months ; P = .01 ) without an impairment in quality of life ( QOL ) . There was no statistically significant difference in survival time between both arms ( 8.7 months for gemcitabine-cisplatin v 7.2 months for etoposide-cisplatin ; P = .18 ) . The overall toxicity profile for both combinations of drugs was similar . Nausea and vomiting were reported more frequently in the gemcitabine arm than in the etoposide arm . However , the difference was not significant . Gemcitabine-cisplatin produced less grade 3 alopecia ( 13 % v 51 % ) and less grade 4 neutropenia ( 28 % v 56 % ) but more grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia ( 56 % v 13 % ) than did etoposide-cisplatin . However , there were no thrombocytopenia-related complications in the gemcitabine arm . Compared with etoposide-cisplatin , gemcitabine-cisplatin provides a significantly higher response rate and a delay in disease progression without impairing QOL in patients with advanced NSCLC . \" \n",

We measured circulating lipids , insulin-like growth factor 1 , glucose , insulin and insulin sensitivity ( calculated by homeostasis model assessment  HOMA  index ) , leptin , adiponectin , and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio in 235 premenopausal women with pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer ( n = 21 ) , intraepithelial neoplasia ( n = 160 ) , or 5-year Gail risk of 1.3 % or greater ( n = 54 ) who participated in a 2 2 trial of low-dose tamoxifen , fenretinide , both agents , or placebo over a 2-year period . At baseline , adiponectin levels were directly associated with mammographic density and HDL cholesterol and negatively associated with leptin , leptin-to-adiponectin ratio , body mass index ( BMI ) , and HOMA index . Median adiponectin levels were lower in affected than in unaffected women ( P = .006 ) . After a median of 7.2 years and total of 57 breast neoplastic events , there was a 12 % reduction in the risk of breast neoplastic events per unit increase of adiponectin ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.81 to 0.96 ; P = .03 ) . There was no interaction between treatment and adiponectin levels . Low adiponectin levels are associated with a history of prior intraepithelial neoplasia or pT1mic/pT1a breast cancer and higher risk of second breast neoplastic events in premenopausal women . The associations are independent of BMI , mammographic density , and treatment . Our findings support the role of adiponectin as a potential target for premenopausal breast cancer prevention and treatment . \" \n",

A total of 1,275 patients were randomized to either no adjuvant treatment ( 427 patients ) or PeCT ( 848 patients ) . The following variables thought to have prognostic significance were evaluated : grade , tumor size , estrogen ( ER ) and progesterone receptor ( PgR ) content ( absent ; low , 1 to 9 fmol/mg cytosol protein ; or positive , > or = 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein ) , c-erbB-2 overexpression , menopausal status , and age . Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relative influence of these factors to predict the effect of PeCT on disease-free survival ( DFS ) . Median follow-up was 13.5 years . The 10-year DFS percentage for 692 premenopausal patients did not significantly differ between the PeCT and no-adjuvant-treatment groups : 61 % and 59 % , respectively ( relative risk  RR  , 0.95 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.75 to 1.20 ; P = .70 ) . No predictive factors were identified . For 583 postmenopausal patients , 10-year DFS percentages for the groups were 63 % and 58 % , respectively ( RR , 0.75 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 to 0.93 ; P = .03 ) . The absence of expression of ER , PgR , or both ER and PgR was the most important factor predicting improved outcome with PeCT among postmenopausal patients . The 10-year DFS percentages were 85 % and 53 % for the steroid hormone receptor-absent cohort of treated and untreated patients , respectively ( RR , 0.18 ; 95 % CI , 0.06 to 0.49 ; P = .0009 ) . The role of PeCT should be explored for patients whose primary tumors do not express steroid hormone receptors , because it is likely that early initiation of treatment is exclusively relevant for such patients . \" \n",

This study evaluated the incidence of febrile neutropenia and related events in elderly cancer patients receiving pegfilgrastim beginning with cycle 1 ( proactive ) in comparison with pegfilgrastim initiated after cycle 1 at the physician s discretion ( reactive ) ., Patients ( > or = 65 years of age ) with either solid tumors or non-Hodgkin s lymphoma ( NHL ) were randomly assigned to receive pegfilgrastim either proactively or reactively ., The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing febrile neutropenia . There were 852 patients enrolled ( median age , 72 years ) . Proactive pegfilgrastim use resulted in a significantly lower incidence of febrile neutropenia for both solid tumor and NHL patients compared with reactive use . Proactive pegfilgrastim use also led to fewer hospitalizations resulting from neutropenia and febrile neutropenia by approximately 50 % . Antibiotic use was lower for solid tumor patients receiving proactive pegfilgrastim and equivalent in the two NHL groups . This is the largest , randomized , prospective trial evaluating growth factor support in typical elderly cancer patients . Proactive pegfilgrastim use effectively produced a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia and related events in elderly patients with either solid tumors or NHL receiving an array of mild to moderately neutropenic chemotherapy regimens .

Rescue analgesia consisting of buprenorphine SL 02-mg tablets was available as needed throughout the double-blind phase . The main outcome measures were ( 1 ) the number of buprenorphine SL tablets required in addition to buprenorphine TES during the double-blind phase compared with the placebo group and compared with the buprenorphine SL requirement during the run-in phase , and ( 2 ) patients assessments of pain intensity , pain relief , and duration of sleep uninterrupted by pain in the double-blind phase compared with the run-in phase ., Adverse events were documented throughout the study . One hundred thirty-seven patients were included in the double-blind phase ( 90 buprenorphine TES , 47 placebo ) . The buprenorphine TES group included 47 men and 43 women ( mean  SD  age , 56.0  12.1  years ) , and the placebo group included 23 men and 24 women ( mean age , 55.7  12.9  years ) . Forty-five patients had cancer-related pain and 92 had noncancer-related pain . The 2 treatment groups were comparable with respect to sex distribution , age , height , and body weight Patients receiving buprenorphine TES significantly reduced their consumption of buprenorphine SL tablets in the double-blind phase compared with patients receiving placebo ( reduction of 0.6  0.4  mg vs 0.4  0.4  mg ; P = 0.03 ) . The relationship between the buprenorphine SL dose in the run-in phase and the number of buprenorphine SL tablets required in the double-blind phase was dose dependent in the active-treatment group only . Patients assessments of pain intensity and pain relief suggested better analgesia with buprenorphine TES than with placebo , although the differences did not reach statistical significance ., The proportion of patients who reported sleeping for > 6 hours uninterrupted by pain in the double-blind phase compared with the run-in phase increased by 6.4 % in the buprenorphine TDS group ( 35.6 % vs 292 % , respectively ) , compared with a decrease of 5.9 % in the placebo group ( 40.4 % vs 463 % ) ; no statistical analysis of sleep duration data was performed . Buprenorphine TDS was well tolerated , with adverse events generally similar to those associated with other opioids . The incidence of systemic adverse events in the double-blind phase was similar in the 2 treatment groups ( 28.9 % buprenorphine TDS , 27.6 % placebo ) , with the most common adverse events being nausea , dizziness , and vomiting . After patch removal , skin reactions ( mainly mild or moderate pruritus and erythema ) were seen in 35.6 % of the buprenorphine TDS group and 25.5 % of the placebo group . In the population studied , buprenorphine TDS provided adequate pain relief , as well as improvements in pain intensity and duration of pain-free sleep . It may be considered a therapeutic option for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain . \" \n",

At median follow up of 39 months , 32 patients relapsed 19 in the levamisole group and 13 in the non-levamisole group ( p = 0.284 ) . Twenty five patients died of relapsed diseases , 15 in the levamisole group and 10 in the non-levamisole group . The levamisole group tended to show more risk of overall death rate and recurrence than the non-levamisole group . However , this result was not statistically significant at 3 years . The treatment was well tolerated in both treatment groups . The grade 2-3 toxicities were nausea / vomiting ( levamisole , non-levamisole group ; 31.7 % , 29.3 % of treatment courses respectively ) , diarrhea ( 7.6 % , 8.4 % ) , mucositis ( 11.6 % , 12.3 % ) , and leukopenia ( 9.8 % , 9.6 % ) . Levamisole had negative effects on disease-free survival and overall survival when added to adjuvant combination chemotherapy of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in patients with operable gastric cancer . Both treatment arms were generally well tolerated and the toxicity profile was similar with or without levamisole . \" \n",

A randomized , controlled clinical trial was conducted in 120 adult patients with esophageal cancer and undergoing esophagectomy . Patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving either EN ( N. = 64 ) or parenteral nutrition ( PN ) ( N. = 56 ) postoperatively . The nutritional intake was isonitrogenic and isocalorie for both groups . Nutritional status was evaluated preoperatively as well as on postoperative day I and day 8 . Daily nitrogen balance was measured and 7-day cumulative nitrogen balance was calculated . The levels of serum markers including d-lactate , diamine oxidase ( DAO ) , and endotoxin were determined on 1st , 4th and 8th postoperative day for analyzing intestinal barrier function . Postoperative infection rate and the incidence of nutrition support-related complications were examined . The concentrations of serum albumin and prealbumin in patients of EN group were significantly higher than those in PN group and the concentrations of blood glucose , - GT , AKP , TB , and DB were significantly lower compared to those in the PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . Both daily nitrogen balance and cumulative nitrogen balance of EN group were better than those of PN group since postoperative day III . The serum levels of d-lactate , DAO , and endotoxin of EN group were significantly lower than those of PN group on postoperative day VIII ( P < 0.01 ) . The incidence of postoperative infections in blood , lung , and intestinal tract in EN group was lower compared to PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . No severe complications associated with nutritional support occurred in EN group . The time to flatus passage in EN group was significantly shorter , and the cost of nutritional support was significantly less compared to PN group ( P < 0.05 ) . Postoperative early enteral nutrition was safe and feasible for patients undergoing esophagectomy . Compared to PN , EN more efficiently ameliorated postoperational nutritional status of the patients undergoing esophagectomy , played an important role in restoring intestinal barrier function postoperatively , reduced the incidence of postoperative infection , and decreased the cost of hospital stay . \" \n",

A complete remission ( CR ) was obtained in 31 of the 35 patients ( 89 % ) , and 24 patients ( 77 % ) were still in CR after further follow-up . Five patients subsequently developed distant metastases , and 2 had a second vaginal recurrence . The 3-year survival after first relapse was 51 % for patients in the control group and 19 % in the RT group ( P = 0.004 ) . The 3-year survival after vaginal relapse was 73 % , in contrast to 8 and 14 % after pelvic and distant relapse ( P < 0.001 ) . At 5 years , the survival after vaginal relapse was 65 % in the control group compared to 43 % in the RT group . Survival after relapse was significantly better in the patient group without previous RT. . Treatment for vaginal relapse was effective , with 89 % CR and 65 % 5-year survival in the control group , while there was no difference in survival between patients with pelvic relapse and those with distant metastases . As pelvic RT was shown to improve locoregional control significantly , but without a survival benefit , its use should be limited to those patients at sufficiently high risk ( 15 % or over ) for recurrence in order to maximize local control and relapse-free survival . \" \n",

The proportions of patients who were protected by dexamethasone combined with ondansetron or by dexamethasone alone were significantly greater than the proportion protected by placebo ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.02 , respectively ) . Of the 87 patients in the high-risk group , complete protection was achieved in 40.9 percent of those treated with ondansetron and dexamethasone and in 23.3 percent treated with dexamethasone alone ( P not significant ) . The best way to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy is to control these complications within the first 24 hours after the start of chemotherapy . Dexamethasone alone provides adequate protection against delayed emesis in patients at low risk ( those who have not had acute emesis ) . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" A recent randomized trial demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) with weekly cisplatin and gemcitabine , followed by two adjuvant cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine improved survival for advanced cervical cancer patients . An Asian Gynecologic Oncology Group ( AGOG ) study was designed to determine whether only adding gemcitabine in the chemoradiation phase without adjuvant chemotherapy could improve survival . Between March 2009 and March 2013 , 74 eligible patients with International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology stage III/IVA cervical cancer or stage I/II with positive pelvic/para-aortic nodal metastasis were enrolled . Thirty-seven patients were randomized to arm C ( weekly cisplatin 40mg/m ( 2 ) ) and 37 patients were randomized to arm CG ( weekly cisplatin 40mg/m ( 2 ) and gemcitabine 125mg/m ( 2 ) ) , for six cycles . Six eligible patients were excluded before the beginning of treatment . An interim analysis showed superimposable progression-free ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) , a decision of closing accrual was made . A 3-year PFS was similar in both arms ( arm C 65.1 % vs. arm CG 71.0 % , p = 0.71 ) , and a 3-year OS was 74.1 % in arm C vs. 85.9 % in arm CG ( p = 0.89 ) , but crossed over at 5years . Grade 2-4 hematological toxicities , including neutropenia ( p = 0.028 ) and thrombocytopenia ( p = 0.001 ) , were more frequent in arm CG than arm C. Despite limitation in power , it suggests that only adding gemcitabine at the CCRT phase does not provide substantially superior results , but treatment toxicities could increase . Further studies are required to determine the role of post-CCRT adjuvant chemotherapy in advanced cervical cancer . \" \n",

However , the cause of this decrease remains controversial . We analyzed the results of the WHI randomized clinical trial -- in which one study group received 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily and another group received placebo -- and examined temporal trends in breast-cancer diagnoses in the WHI observational-study cohort . Risk factors for breast cancer , frequency of mammography , and time-specific incidence of breast cancer were assessed in relation to combined hormone use . In the clinical trial , there were fewer breast-cancer diagnoses in the group receiving estrogen plus progestin than in the placebo group in the initial 2 years of the study , but the number of diagnoses increased over the course of the 5.6-year intervention period . The elevated risk decreased rapidly after both groups stopped taking the study pills , despite a similar frequency of mammography . In the observational study , the incidence of breast cancer was initially about two times as high in the group receiving menopausal hormones as in the placebo group , but this difference in incidence decreased rapidly in about 2 years , coinciding with year-to-year reductions in combined hormone use . During this period , differences in the frequency of mammography between the two groups were unchanged . The increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of estrogen plus progestin declined markedly soon after discontinuation of combined hormone therapy and was unrelated to changes in frequency of mammography . \" \n",

Blood samples for TNF - , IFN - , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12 , and GM-CSF were obtained before surgery ( T ( pre ) ) , 3 h ( T ( 3h ) ) , and 24 h ( T ( 24h ) ) after skin incision . Data on postoperative complications were prospectively collected and analyzed . In the EA group , IL-4 increased from T ( pre ) to T ( 3h ) and from T ( 3h ) to T ( 24h ) , IL-10 increased from T ( pre ) to T ( 3h ) and persisted unmodified thereafter . At all time-points , IL-4 and IL-10 serum levels were significantly higher than those in the IA group . Conversely , in the IA group , IL-4 and IL-10 serum levels did not change while all other cytokines levels were significantly higher compared with the EA group . In particular , IL-6 progressively reached a 7-fold increase of its basal value at T ( 24h ) . Complications were significantly more common in IA patients ( 13 of 17 ) compared with EA patients ( 7 of 18 ) ( P = .024 ) . Our results indicate that in cancer patients undergoing major elective colon surgery , the EA attenuates the surgery-induced proinflammatory response and the typical postoperative transient immunosuppression and seems associated with a reduced rate of postoperative complications compared with IA . \" \n",

If BOTs are misdiagnosed as cancer , patients may not only experience nonbeneficial morbidity but may have to cope with an incorrect diagnosis of cancer for the rest of their lives . In cases of metastatic disease mistaken for an ovarian primary , more adequate therapeutic modalities may be withheld from some patients . Finally , clinical trials may be biased through unintended disregard of histological inclusion criteria . Patients were recruited for central pathology review according to a translational subprotocol of a prospectively randomized phase 3 study led by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie ( AGO ) Study Group . All original slides were requested , and a specialized central pathology review was performed by experienced gynecopathologists . In cases of clinically relevant diagnostic discrepancies , the pathologist responsible for the original diagnosis was contacted . If a given discrepancy could not be resolved , a panel of experts was involved for clarification . Four hundred fifty-four patients with an original diagnosis of ovarian , tubal , or peritoneal epithelial carcinoma were recruited . In 6.8 % ( 31 patients ) , a major diagnostic discrepancy of clinical relevance was found . Most frequently ( 15 patients ) , serous BOT had been misdiagnosed as invasive cancer . Ovarian metastases constituted the second most frequent misdiagnosis ( 13 patients ) . Minor discrepancies not affecting patient treatment were found in 28.2 % ( 128 patients ) . Specialized central pathology review could help to avoid overtreatment of patients with BOT and inappropriate treatment of patients with ovarian metastases . The implementation of a specialized case review process may translate into enhanced patient safety in clinical trials of ovarian carcinomas . Furthermore , central pathology review may increase the rigor and ultimately the transferability of clinical research into practice and should therefore become a standard procedure in study protocols evaluating new therapies . \" \n",

It is unclear whether in situ carcinoma cell aromatization is the primary source of estrogen production for tumor growth and whether the aromatase expression is predictive of response to endocrine therapy . Due to methodological difficulties in the determination of the aromatase protein , COX-2 , an enzyme involved in the synthesis of aromatase , has been suggested as a surrogate marker for aromatase expression . Primary tumor material was retrospectively collected from 88 patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing the AI letrozole to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen for first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer . Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis was performed for ER , PR , COX-2 and aromatase using Tissue Microarrays ( TMAs ) . Aromatase was also analyzed using whole sections ( WS ) . Kappa analysis was applied to compare association of protein expression levels . Univariate Wilcoxon analysis and the Cox-analysis were performed to evaluate time to progression ( TTP ) in relation to marker expression . Aromatase expression was associated with ER , but not with PR or COX-2 expression in carcinoma cells . Measurements of aromatase in WS were not comparable to results from TMAs . Expression of COX-2 and aromatase did not predict response to endocrine therapy . Aromatase in combination with high PR expression may select letrozole treated patients with a longer TTP . TMAs are not suitable for IHC analysis of in situ aromatase expression and we did not find COX-2 expression in carcinoma cells to be a surrogate marker for aromatase . In situ aromatase expression in tumor cells is associated with ER expression and may thus point towards good prognosis .

This randomized , open-label , phase III study , which was conducted in Japan , included a 1 - to 2-week screening period ( on previous opioid ) and an 8-week , open-label treatment period . Eligible patients , who were taking a strong opioid analgesic and had a mean pain intensity score < 4 during the 3 days prior to randomization ( adequate pain control on previous strong opioid ) , were randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive twice-daily treatment with tapentadol ER ( 100-500 mg/day ) or morphine sustained release ( SR ; 20-140 mg/day ; reference for assay sensitivity ) . Initial doses were estimated based on the conversion ratio of tapentadol ER : oxycodone : morphine : fentanyl = 10:2:3:0.03 . The primary effectiveness endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained pain control  change from baseline in mean pain intensity ( 11-point numerical rating scale ) less than +1.5 for 3 consecutive days and no more than two doses of rescue medication per day for 3 consecutive days ) during the first week of open-label treatment .

This significant overall survival benefit for bicalutamide was driven by a lower risk of prostate cancer-related deaths ( 16.1 vs 24.3 % , respectively ) . There was no significant difference in PFS or overall survival in patients with localized disease ( n = 1,065 ) . In patients with locally advanced disease , bicalutamide 150 mg adjuvant to radiotherapy demonstrates significant clinical benefits in terms of overall survival , PFS and PSA-PFS compared with radiotherapy alone . The overall survival benefit in these patients is consistent with prior studies evaluating castration-based therapies adjuvant to radiotherapy ( Bolla et al. in Lancet 360:103 -108 , 2002 ; Pilepich et al. in Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 61:1285 -1290 , 2005 ) . In addition , the clinical benefit of bicalutamide 150 mg in locally advanced patients , but not in those with localized disease , is consistent with the overall results from the EPC program ( McLeod et al. . BJU Int 97:247 -254 , 2006 ) . Given the quality-of-life advantages of bicalutamide relative to castration , bicalutamide 150 mg adjuvant to radiotherapy is an attractive alternative for men with locally advanced prostate cancer . \" \n",

There were no between-groups differences in participants ratings of convenience , effort , or satisfaction following exposure to the decision aid ., Participants assigned to the video group were more likely to review the materials than individuals assigned to the internet group ( 98.2 % vs 53.5 % ) . Participants in the video group showed significantly greater increases in PSA knowledge and were more likely to decline the PSA test than individuals assigned to the internet group . However , participants in the internet group who reviewed the entire online presentation showed similar increases in PSA knowledge as video participants . Only 5 % of all participants visited other websites to inform themselves about the PSA test . Overall , the video was significantly more effective than the Internet in educating participants about benefits and risks of PSA screening . \" \n",

Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing IHP for unresectable solid tumor LM . Between 2003 and 2012 , IHP was completed in 91 patients . Primary tumor pathology was CRC = 54 , non-CRC = 37 ( ocular/cutaneous melanoma = 32 , cholangiocarcinoma = 3 , appendiceal = 1 , and breast = 1 ) . IHP employed Melphalan ( n = 69 ) ( CRC = 32 , non-CRC = 37 ) , Oxaliplatin ( n = 10 ) ( CRC ) , or Oxaliplatin + 5FU ( n = 12 ) ( CRC ) . Hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) pumps were placed in all CRC patients . There were 3 ( 3.3 % ) perioperative deaths . Response rates for CRC , melanoma , and cholangiocarcinoma were 68.2 % , 57.1 % , and 100 % respectively . Response rates for CRC patients using 5FU + Oxaliplatin , Oxaliplatin , or Melphalan were 83.3 % , 66.7 % , and 60.9 % , respectively . Median OS for the CRC patients ( from IHP date ) was 23 months ( 95 % confidence interval : 15-28 months ) . On univariate analysis , receipt of HAI-FUDR ( floxuridine ) within 1 year of IHP was the only factor associated with improved OS ( P = 0.043 ) in CRC patients . IHP results in excellent response rates for patients with unresectable liver metastasis from solid tumors . Improved local control for CRC patients undergoing IHP-HAI may improve survival . \" \n",

We utilized data from the Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER ) program to compute expected survival in PLCO and compared this to observed . There was no significant difference in prostate-specific survival rates between arms ; 10 year survival rates were 94.7 % ( intervention , n = 4250 cases ) versus 93.5 % ( usual care , n = 3815 cases ) . Within the intervention arm , cases never screened in PLCO had lower 10 year survival rates ( 82 % ) than screen detected or interval ( following a negative screen ) cases , both around 95.5 % . The ratio of observed to expected 10 year prostate-specific death ( 1-survival ) rates was 0.59 ( 95 % CI : 0.51-0 .68 ) for all PLCO cases , 0.66 ( 95 % CI : 0.51-0 .81 ) for Gleason 5-7 cases and 1.07 ( 95 % CI : 0.87-1 .3 ) for Gleason 8-10 cases . Prostate cancer specific survival in PLCO was comparable across arms and significantly better than expected based on nationwide population data . How much of the better survival is due to a healthy volunteer effect and to lead-time and overdiagnosis biases is not readily determinable . \" \n",

The two groups were similar in age , sex , state of the disease , bleeding volume and length of removed esophagus . There was no significant difference between these two groups considering the initial passing of gas , the beginning of their diet , and hospital stay duration . But the incidence of sore throat , nasal discomfort , speech disorders , and patients dissatisfation were higher in the group with NJT ., It seems that patients without NJT were more comfortable and satisfied after total gastrectomy .

In metastatic breast cancer patients with previous exposure to endocrine therapy , the addition of a mammalian target of rapamycine ( mTOR ) inhibitor has been shown to be beneficial . Whether or not patients on adjuvant endocrine treatment might benefit from these drugs is currently unclear . A biomarker that predicts intrinsic resistance could potentially be used as companion diagnostic in this setting . We tested the clinical validity of different downstream-activated proteins in the PI3K and/or MAPK pathways to predict intrinsic tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal primary breast cancer patients . We recollected primary tumor tissue from patients who participated in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen ( 1-3 years ) versus observation . After constructing a tissue micro-array , cores from 563 estrogen receptor positive were immunostained for p-AKT ( Thr308 ) , p-AKT ( Ser473 ) , p-mTOR , p-p706SK and p-ERK1 / 2 . Cox proportional hazard models for recurrence free interval were used to assess hazard ratios and interactions between these markers and tamoxifen treatment efficacy . Interactions were identified between tamoxifen and p-AKT ( Thr308 ) , p-mTOR , p-p70S6K and p-ERK1 / 2 . Applying a conservative level of significance , p-p70S6K remained significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance . Patients with p-p70S6K negative tumors derived significant benefit from tamoxifen ( HR 0.24 , P < 0.0001 ) , while patients whose tumor did express p-p70S6K did not ( HR = 1.02 , P = 0.95 ) , P for interaction 0.004 . In systemically untreated breast cancer patients , p-p70S6K was associated with a decreased risk for recurrence . Patients whose tumor expresses p-p70S6K , as a marker of downstream PI3K and/or MAPK pathway activation , have a favorable prognosis , but do not benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen . A potential benefit from inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in these patients needs to be further explored . \" \n",

Interobserver agreement was relatively low , but overall EUS increased kappa values from 0.16 ( `` poor ) to 0.33 ( `` fair ) , thus indicating increased overall agreement after the EUS results were available ., EUS conclusion regarding stage or resectability was wrong in 17 % of the cases , but only one serious event would have been the clinical result of EUS misinterpretations . Despite being used in different ways by different surgeons , EUS did change patient management in one third of the cases . The impact of EUS misinterpretations seemed very low , and this study confirmed one of the strongest clinical possibilities of EUS , i.e. , the ability to detect nonresectable cases . EUS is an important imaging modality for oncosurgeons from different countries . \" \n",

We report here the results of a large phase III trial investigating adjuvant oral capecitabine compared with 5-FU/LV ( Mayo Clinic regimen ) in Dukes C colon cancer ., Patients aged 18-75 years with resected Dukes C colon carcinoma were randomized to receive 24 weeks of treatment with either oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m ( 2 ) twice daily , days 1-14 every 21 days ( n = 993 ) , or i.v. bolus 5-FU 425 mg/m ( 2 ) with i.v. leucovorin 20 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1-5 , repeated every 28 days ( n = 974 ) ., Patients receiving capecitabine experienced significantly ( P < 0.001 ) less diarrhea , stomatitis , nausea/vomiting , alopecia and neutropenia , but more hand-foot syndrome than those receiving 5-FU/LV . Fewer patients receiving capecitabine experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , febrile neutropenia/sepsis and stomatitis ( P < 0.001 ) , although more experienced grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than those treated with 5-FU/LV ( P < 0.001 ) . Capecitabine demonstrates a similar , favorable safety profile in patients aged < 65 years or > or = 65 years old . Based on its improved safety profile , capecitabine has the potential to replace 5-FU/LV as standard adjuvant treatment for patients with colon cancer .

The preclinical data suggested that it can inhibit proliferation and migration not only in endothelial cells , but also in some types of tumor cells . Theoretically , antiangiogenesis drugs should also be effective in the therapy of other solid tumors , including breast cancer . Here a prospective , randomized , controlled , phase II trial of combining rh-Endostatin and neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety profiles in patients with breast cancer . A total of 68 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive the neoadjuvant DE regimen ( docetaxel : 75 mg/m ( 2 ) , d1 , epirubicin : 75 mg/m ( 2 ) , d1 ) every 3 weeks with or without rh-Endostatin ( 7.5 mg/m ( 2 ) , d1-d14 ) . Surgical resection was performed after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment . The primary end-points were objective response rate ( ORR ) and pathological complete response rate ( PCRR ) while the secondary end-points quality of life ( QOL ) and toxicity . Among all of them , 64 were assessable for efficacy and 68 for toxicity . The ORRs were 90.9 % ( 30/33 ) and 67.7 % ( 21/31 ) in the combination and control groups respectively ( P = 0.021 ) . The stratification analysis showed that rh-Endostatin was more effective in the treatment of pre-menopausal and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) = 0 patients ( P < 0.05 ) . The PCRRs were 15.2 % ( 5/33 ) and 6.5 % ( 2/31 ) in the combination and control groups respectively ( P = 0.428 ) . No significant difference was identified in QOL score and side effects ( P > 0.05 ) . Compared with DE regimen alone , the combination of rh-Endostatin with DE chemotherapy may achieve a higher ORR with no increased toxicity in breast cancer patients . Thus it can be utilized safely and effectively in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer . \" \n",

Management options for localized disease exist , yet an evidence-based criterion standard for treatment still has to emerge . Although 5-year survival rates approach 98 % , all treatment options carry the possibility for significant side effects , such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence . It is therefore recommended that patients be actively involved in the treatment decision process . We have developed an Internet/CD-ROM-based multimedia Prostate Interactive Educational System ( PIES ) to enhance patients treatment decision making ., PIES virtually mirrors a health center to provide patients with information about prostate cancer and its treatment through an intuitive interface , using videos , animations , graphics , and texts . ( 1 ) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the PIES intervention and to report preliminary outcomes of the program in a pilot trial among patients with a new prostate cancer diagnosis , and ( 2 ) to explore the potential impact of tailoring PIES treatment information to participants information-seeking styles on study outcomes ., Participants ( n = 72 ) were patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who had not made a treatment decision . Patients were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions : ( 1 ) control condition ( providing information through standard National Cancer Institute brochures ; 26 % ) , and PIES ( 2 ) with tailoring ( 43 % ) and ( 3 ) without tailoring to a patient s information-seeking style ( 31 % ) ., Questionnaires were administrated before ( t1 ) and immediately after the intervention ( t2 ) . Measurements include evaluation and acceptability of the PIES intervention , monitoring/blunting information-seeking style , psychological distress , and decision-related variables ( eg , decisional confidence , feeling informed about prostate cancer and treatment , and treatment preference ) . The PIES program was well accepted by patients and did not interfere with the clinical routine . About 79 % of eligible patients ( 72/91 ) completed the pre - and post-PIES intervention assessments . Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly more likely to report higher levels of confidence in their treatment choices , higher levels of helpfulness of the information they received in making a treatment decision , and that the information they received was emotionally reassuring . Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly less likely to need more information about treatment options , were less anxious about their treatment choices , and thought the information they received was clear ( P < .05 ) . Tailoring PIES information to information-seeking style was not related to decision-making variables . This pilot study confirms that the implementation of PIES within a clinical practice is feasible and acceptable to patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer . PIES improved key decision-making process variables and reduced the emotional impact of a difficult medical decision . \" \n",

To validate those findings , we conducted immunohistochemical analyses of erbB-2 and p53 protein expression in an additional cohort of 595 patients ( set B ) from CALGB 8541 , as well as a molecular analysis of erbB-2 gene amplification in tumors from all patients ( sets A and B ) . Marker data were compared with clinical , histologic , treatment , and outcome data . Updated analyses of data from set A ( median follow-up , 10.4 years ) showed an even stronger interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose , by use of either immunohistochemical or molecular data . A similar interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose was observed in all 992 patients , analyzed as a single group . However , for set B alone ( median follow-up , 8.2 years ) , results varied with the method of statistical analysis . By use of a proportional hazards model , the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was not significant for all patients . However , in the subgroups of patients randomly assigned to the high - or the moderate-dose arms , significance was achieved . When patient data were adjusted for differences by use of a prognostic index ( to balance an apparent failure of randomization in the low-dose arm ) , the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was significant in all patients from the validation set B as well . An interaction was also observed between p53 immunopositivity and CAF dose . The hypothesis that patients whose breast tumors exhibit high erbB-2 expression benefit from dose-intensive CAF should be further validated before clinical implementation . Interactions between erbB-2 expression , p53 expression , and CAF dose underscore the complexities of predictive markers where multiple interactions may confound the outcome . \" \n",

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of the two LEs in PN in esophageal cancer patients undergoing surgery . Patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma were recruited and allocated randomly to two groups . The test group was given enteral nutrition ( EN ) with PN containing olive oil-based LE after tumor resection for 7 days , and the patients in the control group were supported by EN with MCT/LCT emulsion-based PN after surgery for the same time period . Immunological markers and inflammatory indicators were tested and perioperative clinical outcomes were determined . The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register , number ChiCTR-TRC-13003562 .94 Patients were recruited , and grouped ( olive oil-based LE , n = 46 and MCT/LCT , n = 48 ) , matched for sex , age , body mass index , histological type , TNM stage , and nutrition risk screening ( NRS ) 2002 score . There were no differences in perioperative fever ( > 38 C ) , infectious complications , length of hospital stay ( > 14 days ) , length of critical care stay ( > 2 days ) , time for oral food intake , and in-hospital mortality between the two groups . The test group showed a higher increase in IgG level compared with the MCT/LCT group ( p = 0.028 ) . There was no difference in other immunological markers and inflammatory indicators between the two groups . PN containing olive oil-based or MCT/LCT LEs had similar effects on perioperative outcome , cell-mediated immune function and inflammatory response in esophageal cancer patients who had undergone surgery and were receiving EN . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Glycerol is a low molecular weight solute ( MW 92 D ) that can be used as an osmotic agent in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . Due to its low molecular weight , the osmotic gradient disappears rapidly . Despite the higher osmolality at the beginning of a dwell , ultrafiltration has been found to be lower for glycerol compared to glucose ( MW 180 D ) when equimolar concentrations are used . Previous studies have shown glycerol to be safe for long-term use , but some discrepancies have been reported in small solute transport and protein loss . To assess permeability characteristics for a 1.4 % glycerol dialysis solution compared to 1.36 % glucose . Two standardized peritoneal permeability analyses ( SPA ) , one using 1.4 % glycerol and the other using 1.36 % glucose , in random order , were performed within a span of 2 weeks in 10 stable CAPD patients . The length of the study dwell was 4 hours . Fluid kinetics and solute transport were calculated and signs of cell damage were compared for the two solutions . Peritoneal dialysis unit in the Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam . Median values for the 1.4 % glycerol SPA were as follows : net ultrafiltration 251 mL , which was higher than that for 1.36 % glucose ( 12 mL , p < 0.01 ) ; transcapillary ultrafiltration rate 2.12 mL/min , which was higher than that for glucose ( 1.52 mL/min , p = 0.01 ) ; and effective lymphatic absorption rate 1.01 mL/min , which was not different from the glucose-based solution . Calculation of peritoneal reflection coefficients for glycerol and glucose showed lower values for glycerol compared to glucose ( 0.03 vs 0.04 , calculated with both the convection and the diffusion models ) . A marked dip in dialysate-to-plasma ratio for sodium was seen in the 1.4 % glycerol exchange , suggesting uncoupled water transport through water channels . Mass transfer area coefficients for urea , creatinine , and urate were similar for both solutions . Also , clearances of the macromolecules beta2-microglobulin , albumin , IgG , and alpha2-macroglobulin were not different for the two osmotic agents . The median absorption was higher for glycerol , 71 % compared to 49 % for glucose ( p < 0.01 ) , as could be expected from the lower molecular weight . The use of a 1.4 % glycerol solution during a 4-hour dwell caused a small but significant median rise in plasma glycerol , from 0.22 mmol/L to 0.45 mmol/L ( p = 0.02 ) . Dialysate cancer antigen 125 and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) concentrations during the dwell were not different for both solutions . These findings show that glycerol is an effective osmotic agent that can replace glucose in short dwells and show no acute mesothelial damage . The higher net ultrafiltration obtained with 1.4 % glycerol can be explained by the higher initial net osmotic pressure gradient . This was seen especially in the first hour of the dwell . Thereafter , the osmotic gradient diminished as a result of absorption . The dip in dialysate-to-plasma ratio for sodium seen in the glycerol dwell can also be explained by this high initial osmotic pressure gradient , implying that the effect of glycerol as an osmotic agent is more dependent on intact water channels than is glucose . \" \n",

However , GA can not provide adequate postoperative pain control and routine use of parenteral opioids aggravate postoperative sedation , nausea , emesis , impaired oxygenation and depressed ventilation . Thoracic epidural anesthesia ( TEA ) is one of the regional anesthetic techniques that can be done by using a low dose of local anesthetic in combination with ipsilateral brachial plexus block ( BPB ) for axillary node dissection . TEA can provide a better pain relief without potential paralysis of respiratory muscle and sedation . Fifty ASA PS I-III patients undergoing MRM were randomly assigned to two study groups of 25 patients each . In the TEA group , an epidural catheter was inserted at T4 to T5 , and 10-15 ml of 0.2 % ropivacaine was injected , then interscalene BPB was done with 8 ml of 0.2 % ropivacaine . Anesthesia was maintained with 5-10 ml of 0.2 % ropivacaine per hour . GA was induced with 1 microg/kg of fentanyl followed by 1.5-2 mg/kg of propofol and was maintained with sevoflurane and 70 % N2O in oxygen . The authors evaluated the adequacy of anesthesia , surgical condition , postanesthetic recovery , postanesthetic analgesia and patients satisfaction ., The demographic data was similar in both groups . The number of patients immediately arrived at PACU with a sedation score of 1 was significantly greater in TEA group ( p = 0.003 ) while the number of patients with an Aldrete score of 10 was greater but not statistically significant ( p = 0.25 ) . The verbal rating scale and analgesic requirement were significantly lower in the TEA group ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively ) . Patients satisfaction was greater with TEA than with GA ( p = 0.014 ) ., Surgical condition was similar in both groups . The present study shows that TEA combined with BPB by using a low dose of 0.2 % ropivacaine is a safe and reliable alternative technique for MRM . It can provide not only effective anesthesia but also better postoperative pain relief faster anesthetic recovery and greater patient satisfaction than those of the GA technique . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen with proven efficacy and low toxicity in the treatment of breast cancer . However , tamoxifen has been shown to exert a number of nonhormonal as well as hormonal effects . One nonhormonal effect of tamoxifen is the induction of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) secretion . TGF-beta has been implicated in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced fibrosis . We investigated the development of lung fibrosis in breast cancer patients who were treated after mastectomy with radiotherapy , with or without simultaneous adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen . Data from 196 women were included in the analysis . Eighty-four women were postmenopausal patients who participated in a randomized trial testing tamoxifen as an adjuvant to postmastectomy radiotherapy . The radiotherapy technique employed an 8-MV photon field covering the axillary and the infraclavicular and supraclavicular regions of the affected side of the chest ; the chest wall was treated with an abutted electron field . Optical density changes in pretreatment and post-treatment chest x-ray films were used to monitor the development of lung fibrosis ; lung reactions were assessed in the photon-irradiated field only . Logistic regression analysis was used to explore relationships between radiation dose and the development of lung fibrosis in patients either receiving or not receiving tamoxifen . All P values are from two-sided tests . Among the 84 women who participated in the randomized trial of radiotherapy plus tamoxifen ( n = 38 ) versus radiotherapy alone ( n = 46 ) , there was a significant association between tamoxifen treatment and the incidence of marked lung fibrosis ( relative risk = 2.0 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  = 1.2-3 .5 ; P = .01 ) . When logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate data from all 196 patients , a highly significant relationship was found between the incidence of lung fibrosis and total radiation dose ( P = .0005 ) . In the full analysis , an increased risk of marked lung fibrosis was found again for patients who received tamoxifen simultaneously with radiotherapy ( with patients receiving radiotherapy alone as the referent , odds ratio = 2.9 ; 95 % CI = 1.3-6 .3 ; P = .007 ) . Patient age and menopausal status did not significantly influence the results . Tamoxifen treatment during postmastectomy radiotherapy enhances the risk of radiation-induced lung fibrosis . In view of pre-existing data , we hypothesize that tamoxifen mediates the enhancement of radiation-induced lung fibrosis through the induction of TGF-beta secretion . If this hypothesis is correct , new strategies might be devised for preventing or reducing radiation-induced fibrosis . Because we studied a relatively small portion of the irradiated lung , we can not recommend changes in current therapeutic measures ; however , we strongly encourage additional studies of lung fibrosis in patients receiving tamoxifen and radiotherapy . \" \n",

In patients with KRAS exon 2 mutations , a detrimental effect was seen upon addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 . The current study reports outcomes in subgroups defined by extended RAS testing . Samples from OPUS study KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours were reanalysed for other RAS mutations in four additional KRAS codons ( exons 3-4 ) and six NRAS codons ( exons 2-4 ) using BEAMing . A cutoff of 5 % mutant/wild-type sequences was selected to define RAS status ; we also report an analysis using a cutoff based on the technical lower limit for mutation identification ( 0.1 % ) . Other RAS mutations were detected in 31/118 ( 26 % ) evaluable patients .

In the combined population of patients with any RAS mutation ( KRAS exon 2 or other RAS ) , a clear detrimental effect was associated with addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 . Patients with RAS-mutant mCRC , as defined by mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2-4 , derive no benefit and may be harmed by the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 . Restricting cetuximab administration to patients with RAS wild-type tumours will further tailor therapy to maximise benefit . \" \n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two alternative to estrogens drugs , the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene and the tissue-specific tibolone , on the mammographic appearance of the breast . The study group comprised 131 postmenopausal women aged 41 to 67 years . The women were at least 2 years postmenopausal , free of climacteric symptoms , and at the time of entry to the study had not had therapy for at least 9 months . Women with risk factors for osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease were allocated either to tibolone ( n = 56 ) or raloxifene ( n = 48 ) therapy . Women with no risk factors and women who either did not qualify for or denied treatment ( n = 27 ) served as controls . The study duration was 12 months . Women received a baseline mammogram before commencing therapy and a repeat mammogram at the end of the study period . Mammogram findings were classified according to the modified Wolfe criteria by two expert radiologists . No difference was identified between groups with respect to baseline characteristics associated with breast cancer risk . Similarly , no difference was detected between groups concerning the modified Wolfe classification of baseline mammographic findings . In the tibolone group , 10.7 % of the women showed an increase in breast density in the 12-month reevaluation . The respective figure in the raloxifene group was 6.3 % , whereas no woman in the control group showed an increase in breast density . Differences in the increase in breast density between groups did not , however , reach statistical significance . Accordingly , 10.7 % of women in the tibolone group and 18.8 % of women in the raloxifene group exhibited involutionary changes in the repeat mammogram , whereas 25.9 % of women in the control group revealed a decrease in breast density in the 12-month examination . The percentages were not significantly different between groups . Breast density as shown by mammography was stable in a majority of patients and changed in a minority of cases for both tibolone and raloxifene . In most patients , these drugs are not likely to interfere with mammogram interpretation . Larger long-term studies are needed to confirm the impact of prolonged tibolone or raloxifene administration on mammography . \" \n",

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is a potent modulator of immune effector cells in vitro and in vivo . This study was conducted to determine whether GM-CSF , when administered perioperatively , could reduce the incidence of surgical infections in cancer patients . This was a prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Cancer patients at high risk of infectious surgical morbidity were randomized to receive GM-CSF 125 microg/m2 per day or placebo subcutaneously for 8 days beginning 3 days preoperatively . Routine antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to all patients . Three hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled , with 198 randomized to receive GM-CSF . Twenty-one percent of patients experienced infections during the first 2 weeks postoperatively , and there was no difference in infection rate between the study groups . The most common sites of infection were respiratory tract ( 53 % ) and surgical wound ( 25 % ) . The duration of operation and American Society of Anesthesiology ( ASA ) physical status classification were the most significant predictors of infection in multivariate analysis . GM-CSF was well tolerated and was not associated with fever . The eligibility criteria for this study were successful at defining a patient subgroup at high risk for postoperative infections . At an immunomodulatory dose of 125 microg/m2 per day , GM-CSF was safe and well tolerated , but did not reduce the incidence of postoperative infections in this high-risk oncologic population . Infectious morbidity in surgical oncology remains an important subject for continued clinical investigation . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" We have shown previously that oestrogens attenuate cardiovascular and hormonal responses to stress in perimenopausal women . The cardiovascular role of oestrogens in men is uncertain , despite preliminary evidence that endogenous oestrogens produced by aromatization of androgenic precursors are of physiological importance ; hypogonadal men have very low levels of circulating oestrogen . We therefore studied the haemodynamic and hormonal responses to a standardized laboratory mental stress test in 12 men ( mean age 68.9 + / - 2.6 SEM years ) rendered hypogonadal as a result of treatment for prostatic cancer , before and after 8 weeks of oestrogen supplementation ( oestradiol valerate 1 mg daily , n = 7 ) or placebo ( n = 5 ) . The stress was administered as a standard mental arithmetic test of 10 minutes duration ., Blood pressure , cortisol and ACTH were measured at baseline , and following 5 minutes and 10 minutes of stress , and ACTH again at 25 minutes on both days . Noradrenaline and adrenaline responses to mental stress , as well as changes in total body and forearm spillover of noradrenaline and noradrenaline clearance , were also measured . Oestrogen supplementation was well tolerated , with minimal adverse effects . Mean oestradiol levels increased from < 30 pmol/l to 308 + / - 65 pmol/l after oestrogen treatment . Oestradiol significantly attenuated the mental stress-induced increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures . Oestradiol also attenuated mental stress-induced increases in ACTH , cortisol and adrenaline , but did not influence either total body or forearm spillover of noradrenaline . Responses to stress were unchanged after administration of placebo . We conclude that oestrogen supplementation in men rendered hypogonadal as a result of treatment for prostate cancer is well tolerated and significantly attenuates blood pressure and hormonal responses to psychological stress . These findings suggest the need for further studies to examine a possible clinical role for oestrogen treatment in hypogonadal men . \" \n",

Traditionally , this has been achieved by withdrawing L-thyroxine ( L-T4 ) for 4-6 weeks , inducing hypothyroidism in patients . The availability of a genetically engineered version of the recombinant human TSH ( rh-TSH ) provides an alternative tool to enhance the TSH serum level without inducing hypothyroidism . In this paper the I remnant and red-marrow doses calculated in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) patients pre-treated with rh-TSH are compared to those calculated in patients in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal . Forty-six DTC patients , submitted to I ablative therapy , were randomly divided in group A ( pre-treated with rh-TSH ) and group B ( treated after L-T4 withdrawal for 30 days ) . The red-marrow absorbed dose per unit administered activity and the remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity were calculated for both groups . The red-marrow dose in 17 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.06 + / -0.02 mGy.MBq ; that in 14 hypothyroid patients is 0.09 + / -0.03 mGy.MBq ( two-tailed unpaired t-test P = 0.003 ) . The remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity in 10 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.9 + / -0.8 h ; that calculated in 21 hypothyroid patients is 1.55 + / -1.05 h ( two-tailed unpaired t-test P = 0.063 ) . This last result is mainly due to the difference between the maximum uptake ( U ) in rh-TSH ( U = 0.01 + / -0.01 ) and hypothyroid patients ( U = 0.03 + / -0.02 ) ( two-tailed unpaired t-test P = 0.019 ) . The rh-TSH pre-treated patients seem to have a lower uptake compared to those in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal . On the other hand their red-marrow absorbed dose seems to be lower . \" \n",

After a 6-month period of no contact with study subjects , a follow-up body weight was obtained at 30 months . The nine subjects who dropped out of the study before 12 months all failed to complete a structured psychiatric interview . Of the remaining 39 subjects , 9 had major depressive disorder , and 10 had a definable psychiatric disorder of lesser severity such as adjustment disorder . Subjects with any type of psychiatric diagnosis displayed significantly less weight loss at the 12-month time-point than those with no diagnosis ( 6.3 % vs. 12.6 % loss of baseline weight , respectively ) . At the 30-month follow-up visit , subjects with any psychiatric disorder had a mean weight loss of 1.2 % of baseline weight compared with 7.8 % weight loss in subjects with no diagnosis .

Subjects were assigned randomly to receive a continuous thoracic epidural or paravertebral infusion . Patients in the epidural group were randomized to receive either bupivacaine alone or in combination with hydromorphone . Visual analog scores as well as incentive spirometery results were obtained before and after thoracotomy . Seventy-five consecutive patients presenting for thoracotomy were enrolled in this institutional review board-approved study . On the morning of surgery , subjects were randomized to either an epidural group receiving bupvicaine with and without hydromorphone or a paravertebral catheter-infused bupvicaine . Postoperative visual analog scores and incentive spirometry data were measured in the postanesthesia care unit , the evening of the first operative day , and daily thereafter until postoperative day 4 . Analgesia on all postoperative days was superior in the thoracic epidural group receiving bupivacaine plus hydromorphone . Analgesia was similar in the epidural and continuous paravertebral groups receiving bupivacaine alone . No significant improvement was noted by combining the continuous infusion of bupivacaine via the paravertebral and epidural routes . Incentive spirometry goals were best achieved in the epidural bupivacaine and hydromorphone group and equal in the group receiving bupivacaine alone either via epidural or continuous paravertebral infusion . The current study provided data that fill gaps in the current literature in 3 important areas . First , this study found that thoracic epidural analgesia ( TEA ) with bupivacaine and a hydrophilic opioid , hydromorphone , may provide enhanced analgesia over TEA or continuous paravertebral infusion ( CPI ) with bupivacaine alone . Second , in the bupivacaine-alone group , the increased basal rates required to achieve analgesia resulted in hypotension more frequently than in the bupivacaine/hydromorphone combination group , underscoring the benefit of the synergistic activity . Finally , in agreement with previous retrospective studies , the current data suggest that CPI of local anesthetic appears to provide acceptable analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain . \" \n",

Blood was sampled immediately before and at 15 , 30 , 60 min , 117 , 2 , 5 , 13 , 25 , 49 , 73 , 97 , 121 , 145 and 241 h after the PLD infusion . The plasma level of doxorubicin was determined with LC-MS . The pharmacokinetics of PLD was best described by a one-compartment linear structural model with a long elimination T ( 1/2 ) ( 64 h ) , a slow clearance ( 0025 L/h/m2 ) and a small volume of distribution ( 2310 L/m2 ) . The main toxicities were neutropenia ( 22/44 ) , nausea ( 22/44 ) , vomiting ( 8/44 ) and pigmentation ( 4/44 ) . The nausea and neutropenia were positively correlated with AUC while negatively correlated with Cl ( P < 005 ) . The study confirms the different pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of PLD compared with non-liposomal doxorubicin . The pharmacokinetic profiles in Chinese patients with breast tumours is different from those reported for European patients with metastatic breast cancer . The correlation between toxicities , neutropenia grade and nausea and two of the pharmacokinetic parameters , AUC and Cl , may be useful for guiding the dosing of the agent . \" \n",

Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for days 0 through 28 ( AUC 0-28 ) was proportional for fulvestrant 50 , 125 , and 250 mg . For a doubling of the dose , an analysis of covariance model of the pharmacokinetic data projected an estimated increase in AUC 0-28 of a factor of 1.84 ( 95 % CI , 1.67 to 2.04 ) .

Twenty sedentary females with breast carcinoma who were ages 35 to 65 years were randomized to aerobic exercise ( AE ) of walking for 20 to 45 minutes , 3 to 5 times per week , at 50 % to 70 % of measured maximum heart rates or to placebo stretching ( PS ) activities 3 to 5 days per week during 7 weeks of radiation treatment . Measures were obtained 1 week before and after the radiation regimen . Serum blood analyses , through complete blood counts , measured red blood cell counts ( RBC ) , hematocrit ( HCT ) , and hemoglobin ( HB ) . Peak aerobic capacity ( peak VO ( 2 ) ) was measured by exercise testing with oxygen uptake analysis to assess training . A Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test examined changes between groups ( P < or = .05 for significance ) . AE peak VO ( 2 ) increased by 6.3 % ( P = .001 ) and PS decreased by 4.6 % ( P = .083 ) . RBC increased in AE from 4.10 to 4.21 million cells/microL and declined in PS from 4.30 to 4.19 million cells/microL ; the between-group differences were significant ( P = .014 ) . HCT increased in AE from 38.0 % to 38.8 % and declined in PS from 37.40 % to 36.50 % ; the between-group differences were significant ( P = .046 ) . HB increased in AE from 12.3 to 12.4 g/dL and declined in PS from 12.25 to 11.77 g/dL ; the between-group differences were significant ( P = .009 ) . The results of the current study suggest that moderate intensity aerobic exercise appears to maintain erythrocyte levels during radiation treatment of breast cancer compared with the declines observed in nontraining individuals . These findings suggest a safe , economical method to improve fitness and maintain erythrocytes in women during radiation treatment of breast cancer . \" \n",

In the present study , a contact endoscope was coupled with the systems of image-enhanced endoscopy , as to precisely distinguish the peculiar neoangiogenetic changes in inflammation , and precancerous and cancerous lesions of the larynx and hypopharynx . We performed a single-blind study with this original approach of a series of 44 patients with different lesions of the larynx and hypopharynx . We observed five obvious vascular patterns matching the diagnosis in 41 patients out of 44 , with accuracy in the differential diagnosis between normal tissue and hyperplasia versus mild dysplasia and carcinoma of 97.6 % . Enhanced contact endoscopy allows for predicting histologic changes of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal lesions from inflammation to cancer on based on fine evaluation of the neoangiogenetic changes of the chorion . This innovative procedure can be considered an important tool during diagnosis , treatment , and follow-up of patients with precancer and cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx . \" \n",

We conducted this study to assess CD8 + ( cytotoxic T ) lymphocyte infiltration in a large cohort of invasive early stage breast cancers , and to evaluate its prognostic effect in different breast cancer intrinsic subtypes . Immunohistochemistry for CD8 staining was performed on tissue microarrays from 3992 breast cancer patients . CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were counted as intratumoral when in direct contact with tumor cells , and as stromal in adjacent locations . Kaplan-Meier functions and Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to examine the associations between tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and breast cancer specific survival . Among 3403 cases for which immunohistochemical results were obtained , CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were identified in an intratumoral pattern in 32 % and stromal pattern in 61 % of the cases . In the whole cohort , the presence of intratumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly correlated with young age , high grade , estrogen receptor negativity , human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positivity and core basal intrinsic subtype , and was associated with superior breast cancer specific survival . Multivariate analysis indicated that the favorable prognostic effect of CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was significant only in the core basal intrinsic subgroup ( Hazard ratio , HR = 0.35 , 95 % CI = 0.23-0 .54 ) . No association with improved survival was present in those triple negative breast cancers that lack expression of basal markers ( HR = 0.99 , 95 % CI = 0.48-2 .04 ) nor in the other intrinsic subtypes . CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are an independent prognostic factor associated with better patient survival in basal-like breast cancer , but not in non-basal triple negative breast cancers nor in other intrinsic molecular subtypes . \" \n",

We investigated the discordance of paired liver biopsies in individuals undergoing gastric bypass . Two liver biopsies , composite size of > or = 25 mm and > or = 8 portal tracts ( PTs ) , were obtained from the left lobe in 31 subjects . Group 1 included specimens at least 15 mm in length with > or = 4 PTs compared to a second biopsy of at least 10 mm and > or = 4 PTs ( Group 2 ) . The mean specimen size ( number of PTs ) for group 1 was 20.4 + / - 4.2 mm ( 11.7 + / - 5.5 PTs ) and group 2 was 16.1 + / - 5.3 mm ( 8.2 + / - 4.1 PTs ) . Prevalence of NASH was 26 % in Group 1 and 32 % in Group 2 . Sampling discordance was greatest for portal fibrosis ( 26 % ) , followed by zone 3 fibrosis ( 13 % ) and ballooning degeneration ( 3 % ) . The negative predictive values from Group 1 liver biopsies for NASH and portal fibrosis were only 83 % and 67 % , respectively . The results demonstrate that significant sampling variability exists in class 2 and 3 obese individuals undergoing screening liver biopsies for NAFLD . The degree and histopathological discordance is dependent upon zonal location and types of injury . Nevertheless , a 25-mm biopsy specimen without zone 3 cellular ballooning or fibrosis appears adequate to exclude the diagnosis of NASH . \" \n",

In this study we have investigated alternative activation of beta-catenin by HGF/c-Met signaling in a large cohort of 98 HB patients enrolled in the SIOPEL-3 clinical trial . We performed immunohistochemistry , using antibodies to total beta-catenin and tyrosine654-phosphorylated beta-catenin , which is a good surrogate marker of HGF/c-Met activation . CTNNB1 mutation analysis was also carried out on all samples . We also investigated beta-catenin pathway activation in two liver cancer cell lines , HuH-6 and HuH-7 . Aberrant beta-catenin expression was seen in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of 87 % of tumour samples . Our results also revealed a large subset of HB , 83 % , with cytoplasmic expression of tyrosine654-phosphorylated beta-catenin and 30 % showing additional nuclear accumulation . Sequence analysis revealed mutations in 15 % of our cohort . Statistical analysis showed an association between nuclear expression of c-Met-activated beta-catenin and wild type CTNNB1 ( P-value = 0.015 ) . Analysis of total beta-catenin and Y654-beta-catenin in response to HGF activation in the cell lines , mirrors that observed in our HB tumour cohort .

Internationally the standard of care of first-line therapy is sunitinib , after a clear survival benefit was demonstrated over interferon - . Convention dictates that sunitinib is continued until evidence of disease progression , assuming tolerability , although there is no evidence that this approach is superior to intermittent periods of treatment . The purpose of the STAR trial is to compare the standard treatment strategy ( conventional continuation strategy , CCS ) with a novel drug free interval strategy ( DFIS ) which includes planned treatment breaks . The STAR trial is an NIHR HTA-funded UK pragmatic randomised phase II/III clinical trial in the first-line treatment of advanced RCC . Participants will be randomised ( 1:1 ) to either a sunitinib CCS or a DFIS . The overall aim of the trial is to determine whether a DFIS is non-inferior , in terms of 2-year overall survival ( OS ) and quality adjusted life years ( QALY ) ( averaged over treatment and follow up ) , compared to a CCS . The QALY primary endpoint was selected to assess whether any detriment in terms of OS could be balanced with improvements in quality of life ( QoL ) . This is a complex trial with a number of design challenges , and to address these issues a feasibility stage is incorporated into the trial design . Predetermined recruitment ( stage A ) and efficacy ( stage B ) intermediary endpoints must be met to allow continuation to the overall phase III trial ( stage C ) . An integral qualitative patient preference and understanding study will occur alongside the feasibility stage to investigate patients feelings regarding participation or non-participation in the trial ., The optimal duration of continuing sunitinib in advanced RCC is unknown . Novel targeted therapies do not always have the same constraints to treatment duration as standard chemotherapeutic agents and currently there are no randomised data comparing different treatment durations . Incorporating planned treatment breaks has the potential to improve QoL and cost effectiveness , hopefully without significant detriment on OS , as has been demonstrated in other cancer types with other treatments .

Pain palliation and global quality of life ( QOL ) were the two primary patient-reported outcomes . Pain was measured with the Present Pain Intensity scale of the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form . The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 ( QLQ-C30 ) and its Prostate Cancer Module ( PR25 ) measured QOL and symptom status . Pain and analgesic use were measured at random assignment , every cycle for eight cycles , and 1 year from random assignment ; the QLQ-C30 and the PR25 were administered at random assignment , before cycle four ( week 10 ) and cycle eight ( month 6 ) and at 1 year . In addition to the primary intent-to-treat , missing at random analysis , sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of global QOL conclusions under alternative informative missing data assumptions . Six hundred seventy four eligible patients received DE ( n = 338 ) or MP ( n = 336 ) . In an intention-to-treat analysis , median overall survival was 17.5 months for the DE arm and 15.6 months for the MP arm ( P = .02 ) . There were no statistically significant differences in pain palliation between the treatment arms . The sensitivity analyses showed a consistent lack of statistically significant global QOL differences for the two arms . DE had superior clinical efficacy ( overall survival , time-to-progression , and prostate-specific antigen declines ) with similar global QOL and pain palliation in the MP arm . \" \n",

By January 1 , 2003 , 1,269 cancers were detected in the screening arm and 336 were detected in the control arm . A shift to more favorable clinical stages and histological grades on biopsy was seen in the screening arm of the trial . T1C and T2 cancers were 5.8 and 6.2 times more often diagnosed , respectively , in the screening arm than in the control arm of the trial . Only 4.6 % of control arm cancers were found through opportunistic screening .

Forty-five abstinent heroin addicts were randomly assigned to three treatment groups : placebo , 5 microg TTX , or 10 microg TTX . Participants were exposed to a neutral video or a heroin-related video . Craving , anxiety , blood pressure , and heart rate were measured pre - and post-exposure . Heroin-related cues increased both craving and anxiety and had no effect on blood pressure and heart rate . A single dose of TTX dose-dependently attenuated the increases in craving and anxiety while having no effect on blood pressure or heart rate .

RNA from fresh frozen ( FF ) and FFPE tumor samples of 82 patients were used for quality control , and independent FFPE tissues of 342 postmenopausal participants of BIG 1-98 with ER-positive cancer were analyzed by measuring prospectively selected genes and computing scores representing the functions of the estrogen receptor ( eight genes , ER_8 ) , the progesterone receptor ( five genes , PGR_5 ) , Her2 ( two genes , HER2_2 ) , and proliferation ( ten genes , PRO_10 ) by quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR ) on TaqMan Low Density Arrays . Molecular scores were computed for each category and ER_8 , PGR_5 , HER2_2 , and PRO_10 scores were combined into a RISK_25 score . Pearson correlation coefficients between FF - and FFPE-derived scores were at least 0.94 and high concordance was observed between molecular scores and immunohistochemical data . The HER2_2 , PGR_5 , PRO_10 and RISK_25 scores were significant predictors of disease free-survival ( DFS ) in univariate Cox proportional hazard regression . PRO_10 and RISK_25 scores predicted DFS in patients with histological grade II breast cancer and in lymph node positive disease . The PRO_10 and PGR_5 scores were independent predictors of DFS in multivariate Cox regression models incorporating clinical risk indicators ; PRO_10 outperformed Ki-67 labeling index in multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses . Scores representing the endocrine responsiveness and proliferation status of breast cancers were developed from gene expression analyses based on RNA derived from FFPE tissues . The validation of the molecular scores with tumor samples of participants of the BIG 1-98 trial demonstrates that such scores can serve as independent prognostic factors to estimate disease free survival ( DFS ) in postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer . \" \n",

The men were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 6 months of neoadjuvant ( short-term ) androgen suppression ( STAS ) with leuprorelin ( 225 mg every 3 months , intramuscularly ) or an additional 12 months ( intermediate-term androgen suppression  ITAS  ) of leuprorelin with or without 18 months of zoledronic acid ( 4 mg every 3 months , intravenously ) . Study drug administration commenced at randomisation after which radiotherapy started within the fifth month in all groups . Treatment allocation was open-label , and computer-generated randomisation , stratified by centre , baseline concentrations of PSA , clinical stage of the tumour , Gleason score , and use of a brachytherapy boost , was done by use of the minimisation technique . PRO scores were calculated from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life and prostate-specific quality-of-life module questionnaires and compared with multiple regression models at baseline , and end of radiotherapy , and 18 months and 36 months according to group and radiation dose . The trial is ongoing and the primary endpoint , prostate-cancer-specific mortality , will be reported in 2014 . This study is the final report of PRO scores ( a secondary endpoint ) . Analysis was by intention to treat . This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00193856 . 1071 men were randomly assigned to STAS ( n = 268 ) , STAS plus zoledronic acid ( n = 268 ) , ITAS ( n = 268 ) , and ITAS plus zoledronic acid ( n = 267 ) .

With the exception of HTRS , in which marginal differences remained , persisting significant differences disappeared by 36 months . Other factors associated with significant detrimental changes in PRO scores were a brachytherapy boost , incomplete testosterone and haemoglobin recoveries , age , and smoking . Compared with 6 months of androgen suppression , 18 months of androgen suppression causes additional detrimental changes at the 18 month follow-up in some PRO scores but not in global quality-of-life scores . However , with the exception of HTRS , these differences resolved by 36 months . The use of zoledronic acid every 3 months over 18 months does not result in additional detrimental changes , but the use of a brachytherapy boost to achieve radiation dose escalation in the prostate can adversely affect emotional function and financial problems .

This costing study was based on the retrospective collection of resource use data from hospital records . Case notes from 194 patients ( 98 chemotherapy + supportive care ( C ) , 96 supportive care alone ( NoC ) ) were inspected in eight centres recruiting the largest numbers of patients into the Big Lung Trial . Quantities were multiplied by fixed unit costs to calculate a total cost for each patient . The main outcome measure was the total cost incurred by the use of secondary care resources ( including investigations , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgical procedures , inpatient days , outpatient attendances , and hospice inpatient care ) in the two groups . Patients randomised to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy had an average of 3.4 more inpatient bed days than the mean of 11.9 days for patients randomised to supportive care alone , and more outpatient attendances . NoC patients were more likely to have received palliative radiotherapy . The mean total cost for C patients was 5355 sterling pound compared with 3595 sterling pound for the NoC group , difference 760 sterling pound ( 95 % CI 781 sterling pound to 2742 sterling pound ) . When split , the cost in the C group associated with the administration of chemotherapy was 1233 sterling pound and non-chemotherapy costs were 4122 sterling pound . The additional cost of chemotherapy was not offset by a reduction in subsequent costs ( as the non-chemotherapy costs were similar ) , so the survival benefit of about 10 weeks observed in the C group was achieved with the cost of chemotherapy administration . \" \n",

Mitomycin C ( 20 mg . / 50 ml . sodium chloride ) was given every 2 weeks during year 1 and once a month during year 2 . BCG ( 120 mg/50 ml . sodium chloride was instilled once a week for 6 weeks and once a month for 4 months . At a median followup of 20.2 months , a decrease in recurrence rate was noted for both drug instillations compared to transurethral resection only . The relative risk of recurrence was 0.508 after mitomycin C and 0.618 after BCG instillation compared to transurethral resection alone . There was no significant difference between the mitomycin C and BCG instillations . The progression rate was comparable in all 3 therapy groups , with an estimated common progression rate of 4.22 % per year . Side effects occurred most frequently during or after BCG instillation , most often consisting of cystitis . One patient required cystectomy because of ulcerating cystitis and a prostatic abscess subsequent to unsuccessful tuberculostatic therapy . There were no systemic complications . Our study showed a positive effect of adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy on decreasing tumor recurrence rate .

Fractures were identified by self-report in 2007 . The risk for any fracture or osteoporotic fracture was modeled using Cox proportional hazard models . Over a median follow-up of 7.8 y , 123 participants with plasma samples reported an incident fracture . Although plasma retinol concentrations were markedly higher than those reported in observational studies , no association was observed between plasma retinol and risk for any fracture ( hazard ratio  HR  , 0.86 mol/L ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.65-1 .14 ) or osteoporotic fracture ( HR , 0.97 mol/L ; 95 % CI , 0.66-1 .43 ) .

Both groups additionally received non-blinded emollient cream daily . The intensity of the acute radiation dermatitis was evaluated on a weekly basis regarding erythema and pigmentation , using a reflectance spectrophotometer together with visual scoring of the skin reactions . MMF in combination with emollient cream treatment significantly decreased acute radiation dermatitis ( P = 0.0033 ) compared with emollient cream alone .

PRIOR RESULTS : The final results of the recently completed Physicians Health Study I ( PHS I ) , a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in 22,071 healthy US male physicians , indicated that beta-carotene supplementation ( 50 mg on alternate days ) had no significant benefit or harm on cancer or CVD during more than 12 years of treatment and follow-up ., In regards to cancer , there were possible benefits on total and prostate cancer in those with low baseline levels assigned to beta-carotene , a finding compatible with the Chinese Cancer Prevention Study for combined treatment with beta-carotene , vitamin E , and selenium in a poorly nourished population . Further , with respect to CVD , there were apparent benefits of beta-carotene supplementation on subsequent vascular events among a small subgroup of 333 men with prior angina or revascularization . The currently available data from randomized trials of primary prevention are sparse and inconsistent for vitamin E and non-existent for vitamin C and multivitamins . For eye diseases , namely cataract and age-related macular degeneration , there are no completed large-scale randomized trials of antioxidant vitamins . PHS II is unique in several respects . PHS II is the only primary prevention trial in apparently healthy men testing the balance of benefits and risks of vitamin E on cancer and CVD . In addition , PHS II is the only primary prevention trial in apparently healthy men to test the balance of benefits and risks of vitamin C , multivitamins , as well as any single antioxidant vitamin , alone and in combination , on cancer , CVD , and eye diseases . Finally , PHS II is the only trial testing a priori the hypotheses that beta-carotene and vitamin E may reduce the risks of prostate cancer .

Stent diameter ( 10 Fr ) and length ( 11 cm ) were similar but both stent design and material were different : a Tannenbaum design stent with a stainless steel mesh and an inner Teflon coating , and an Amsterdam-type PE stent . Sixty patients were evaluated ; 30 in the TTC group and 30 in the PE group . Early complications occurred in two patients in each group . Stent dysfunction occurred in 18 of TTC stents and 12 of PE stents . Median stent patency was 102 days for TTC and 142 days for PE stents ( P = 0.41 ) . Median survival did not differ significantly for both treatment groups ( TTC , 121 days ; PE , 105 days ) . Stent migration , in all cases proximal into the common bile duct , occurred in four patients in the TTC group versus zero in the PE group ( P = 0.038 ) . This study did not confirm improved patency of Tannenbaum-type Teflon-coated stents . Proximal migration prompts for additional design modifications . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol R-03 was designed to determine the worth of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the management of operable rectal cancer . Thus far , 116 patients of an eventual 900 with primary operable rectal cancer have been randomized to receive multimodality therapy to begin preoperatively ( 59 patients ) or identical therapy beginning after curative surgery ( 57 ) . All patients received seven cycles of 5-fluorouracil ( FU ) / leucovorin ( LV ) chemotherapy . Cycles 1 and 4 through 7 used a high-dose weekly FU regimen . In Cycles 2 and 3 , FU and low-dose LV chemotherapy was given during the first and fifth week of radiation therapy ( 5,040 cGy ) . The preoperative arm ( Group 1 ) received the first three cycles of chemotherapy and all radiation therapy before surgery . The postoperative arm ( Group 2 ) received all radiation and chemotherapy after surgery . Primary study end points included disease-free survival and survival . Secondary end points included local recurrence , primary tumor response to combination therapy , tumor downstaging , and sphincter preservation . Overall treatment-related toxicity was similar in both groups . Although seven preoperative patients had events after randomization that precluded surgery , eight events occurred during an equivalent follow-up period in the postoperative group . No patient was deemed inoperable because of progressive local disease . Sphincter-saving surgery was intended in 31 percent of Group 1 patients and 33 percent of Group 2 patients at the time of randomization . Such surgery was actually performed in 50 percent of the preoperatively treated patients and 33 percent of the postoperatively treated patients . The use of protective colostomy in patients undergoing sphincter-sparing surgery and the development of perioperative complications in all surgical patients were similar in both groups . There was evidence of tumor downstaging in evaluable patients undergoing preoperative therapy , with 8 percent of Group 1 patients having had a pathologic complete response . These data do suggest that the preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen used are , at least , as safe and tolerable as standard postoperative treatment . There is presently a trend to tumor downstaging and sphincter preservation in the preoperative arm . Whether this arm will have greater or lesser survival and long-term toxicity awaits the completion of this relevant study . \" \n",

Five-year overall survival was significantly ( p = 0.029 ) better in the bicalutamide-treated group . Moreover , M1 patients in the chlormadinone group had significantly lower cancer-specific and overall survival compared to those in the bicalutamide-treated group . However , in the case of M0 patients , no significant difference in cancer-specific nor in overall survival was observed . CAB therapy using chlormadinone led to a significantly poorer survival outcome versus the use of bicalutamide . However , because this survival trend was not observed in M0 cases , chlormadinone may still be an option for CAB therapy , depending on clinical stage and the severity of adverse effects , such as hot flashes . \" \n",

Seventy six patients undergoing surgery and treatment for rectal cancer were randomly assigned to an intervention ( n = 43 ) or control group ( n = 33 ) . The intervention group received an information pack tailored according to their treatment plan and preferred information . The control group received the information currently given to these patients . Satisfaction with information was measured using the Patient Satisfaction with Cancer Treatment Education ( PSCaTE ) scale , anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) and readjustment was measured using the Reintegration to Normal Living Index , at three time points . There was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group on pre and post intervention scores with patients in the intervention group expressing a higher level of satisfaction with information than those in the control group at Times 2 and 3 ( p = 0.00 for both ) . The intervention group also had a significantly lower anxiety score than the control group at Time 3 ( p = 0.03 ) . There was no difference between depression and readjustment scores in the two groups . The results support the hypothesis that a tailored information pack for patients with rectal cancer will positively affect satisfaction with information . These results will enhance the knowledge base surrounding the provision of tailored information to specific patient groups . \" \n",

However , the advantages of giving PRE to all patients needs to be balanced against any negative impact on patients quality of life ., All 1,350 patients were asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item ( MOS SF-36 ) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorectal 38-item ( EORTC QLQ-CR38 ) questionnaires . A priori hypotheses related to the impact of treatment on sexual , bowel , and physical function and general health . Male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased following surgery ( P < .001 ) , although there was no difference between treatment arms . However , a treatment difference had emerged at 6 months ( PRE patients reporting significantly greater dysfunction ; P = .004 ) , which persisted out to at least 2 years ( an insufficient number of female patients completed the sexual dysfunction questions to draw firm conclusions ) . Both treatment groups reported similar levels of decreased physical function at 3 months , but thereafter it returned to baseline levels . There was no evidence of any major changes between treatments or time points in terms of general health or bowel function , but exploratory analysis indicated a significant ( P = .006 at 2 years ) increase in the level of fecal incontinence with PRE . These results from a large randomized trial using validated patient-completed questionnaires show that , for males , the main adverse effect was sexual dysfunction , and the main cause of this was surgery , but that PRE also affected sexual and some aspects of bowel functioning . \" \n",

Thirty GCC patients were randomly assigned to resistance training ( resistance training group ( INT ) , n = 15 ) or usual care ( CON , n = 15 ) during 9 weeks of BEP therapy . Resistance training consisted of thrice weekly sessions of four exercises , 3-4 sets/exercise of 10-15 repetitions at 12-15 repetition maximum load . The primary endpoint was muscle fibre size , assessed in muscle biopsies from musculus vastus lateralis . Secondary endpoints were fibre phenotype composition , body composition , strength , blood biochemistry and patient-reported endpoints . Healthy age-matched subjects ( REF , n = 19 ) performed the same RT-programme for comparison purposes . Muscle fibre size decreased by -322 m ( 2 ) ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : -899 to 255 ; P = 0.473 ) in the CON-group and increased by +206 m ( 2 ) ( 95 % CI : -384 to 796 ; P = 0.257 ) in the INT-group ( adjusted mean difference ( AMD ) , +625 m ( 2 ) , 95 % CI : -253 to 1503 , P = 0.149 ) .

The REF-group improved all muscular endpoints and had significantly superior changes compared with the INT-group ( P < 0.05 ) . BEP was associated with significant reduction in lean mass and strength and trends toward unfavourable changes in muscle fibre size and phenotype composition . Resistance training was safe and attenuated dysfunction in selected endpoints , but BEP blunted several positive adaptations observed in healthy controls . Thus , our study does not support the general application of resistance training in this setting but larger-scaled trials are required to confirm this finding . \" \n",

We attempted to determine whether higher dose chemotherapy for ovarian cancer was possible given the pharmacologic use of this important growth factor . We conducted a randomized , double-blind phase II study of IL-6 plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) versus placebo plus G-CSF in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen . Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer , stages Ic to IV , were eligible . All patients were previously untreated with chemotherapy and had Karnofsky performance status > / = 60 . rhuIL-6 ( Escherichia coli , SDZ ILS 969 ) 1.0 micrograms/kg or placebo was given subcutaneously on days 2-8 every cycle together with G-CSF 5.0 micrograms/kg subcutaneously days 2-15 , following administration of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-h infusion and carboplatin given to a desired AUC of 7.5 on day 1 every 21 days . Fifty patients were entered in this study , although the study was temporarily suspended by the FDA in midstudy over manufacturing concerns . Therefore , 37 patients were evaluable for efficacy of growth factor ; 19 patients received placebo plus G-CSF and 18 rhIL-6 plus G-CSF . There was no difference in prognostic variables between these two groups . Platelet nadirs were lower in the first cycle for the placebo group ( P = 0.004 , Wilcoxon sum-rank test ) but not in other cycles . There was no statistically significant difference in cycle treatment delays , carboplatin dose delivered , number of patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia , or platelet transfusion . Nonetheless , the trend of the data favored IL-6 in all cases . This study demonstrated a minimal effect ( statistically significant in the first cycle only ) on thrombopoiesis in women undergoing paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy of ovarian cancer . No clinically significant effect on actual chemotherapy delivery was demonstrated , however . Future studies , if warranted , to ameliorate thrombocytopenia should be carried out with regimens producing even greater thrombocytopenia than the current regimen in the control arm . \" \n",

The mean PSA level showed no significant secondary rise after LH-RHa administration in those patients with FLU pretreatment . Patients in both groups showed T flare after the first LH-RHa administration . However , the number of patients with PSA flare was significantly lower in patients with prior FLU administration than in those with LH-RHa alone . These results clearly demonstrate that , in patients with prostatic cancer , the administration of FLU for 2 weeks prior to the first LH-RHa administration is effective in preventing PSA flare , as well as in inducing an early decline in PSA levels . \" \n",

After resection , CA 19-9 levels were drawn at baseline , 4 weeks , and 12-week intervals thereafter . CA 19-9 velocity denotes rate of change in CA 19-9 levels over a 4-week period . Postoperative baseline CA 19-9 levels and CA 19-9 velocity were correlated with disease-free and overall survival . Data are presented as median ( mean + / - SD ) . Disease-free survival was 7 months ( 14 + / - 13.7 ) , and overall survival was 12 months ( 19 + / - 14.3 ) with 24 ( 25 % ) patients alive at 41 months ( 39 + / - 7.8 ) . Baseline CA 19-9 levels and CA 19-9 velocity predicted disease-free ( p < 0.01 ) and overall survival ( p < 0.01 ) . CA 19-9 velocity was a better predictor of overall survival than baseline CA 19-9 ( p < 0.001 ) . CA 19-9 velocity at disease progression was 131 U/ml/4-weeks ( 1,684 + / - 4,474.8 ) vs. 1 U/ml/4-weeks ( 1 + / - 3.8 ) at 22 months for patients without disease progression ( p < 0.001 ) . CA 19-9 velocity predicts imminent disease progression after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is a better predictor of overall survival than baseline CA 19-9 levels . CA 19-9 velocity is a reliable and relatively inexpensive means of monitoring patients after resection of pancreatic cancer and should be considered in all patients enrolled in clinical trials as well as patients receiving adjuvant therapy . \" \n",

In this study , we explore the potential benefits of administering a protease inhibitor to treat immunosuppression caused by surgical stress . Sixteen patients with esophageal cancer were preoperatively allocated at random into two equal groups . A urinary trypsin inhibitor , ulinastatin ( UTI ) , was intravenously administered to the treatment ( UTI ) group at a dose of 150,000 U every 12 h from the start of surgery until postoperative day 5 , whereas the control group received a placebo . One unit of UTI was defined as the amount of UTI necessary to inhibit the activity of 2 microg of bovine pancreatic trypsin by 50 % . We measured the plasma levels of polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase , interleukin 8 , circulating T lymphocyte subsets , and mitogenic activity and in vitro production of tumor necrosis factor alpha in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood . The postoperative serum value of polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase was significantly lower in the UTI group , but the interleukin 8 concentrations did not significantly vary between the two groups . On the other hand , the severity of the postoperative immunosuppression was reduced in the UTI group , and immune functions , such as the numbers of T lymphocytes , the mitogenic activity of lymphocytes , and the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha production in whole blood , recovered significantly earlier in the UTI group .

Endpoints included overall response rate ( primary ) , survival , toxicity , and quality of life ( secondary ) . SPARC expression in prechemotherapy specimens of primary gastric tumors was evaluated via immunohistochemical analysis . Eighty patients were enrolled in the study . Confirmed overall response rates were 46 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 30 % -62 % ) for DS and 24 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 11 % -38 % ) for DC via intent-to-treat analysis . Median progression-free survival was 7.3 and 4.9 months and overall survival was 16.0 and 8.3 months for DS and DC , respectively . The most common grade 3 toxicity was neutropenia . Grade 3 mucositis ( 18 % ) and hand-foot syndrome ( 8 % ) were the toxicities most associated with DS , whereas anorexia ( 20 % ) and lethargy ( 20 % ) were more common with DC . High SPARC expression was related to early progression ( hazard ratio , 3.67 ; P = .042 ) and poor overall survival ( hazard ratio , 2.01 ; P = .010 ) in docetaxel chemotherapy on multivariate analysis . The outcomes in this study favored DS over DC for further phase 3 study . The findings suggest that split-dose weekly docetaxel alleviates hematological toxicity without compromising efficacy , and that SPARC expression may help individualize therapy in advanced gastric cancer . \" \n",

Although resection , including the mediastinal lymph nodes , is currently regarded as the standard treatment , the survival rate of this disease is not encouraging . It is well known that the most common causes of death are locoregional recurrences or distant metastases , or both . However , the best adjuvant treatment to improve survival is as controversial an issue as ever . This study was designed as a randomized , blinded , two-armed study with operation and adjuvant radiotherapy in one arm , versus operation and adjuvant mitomycin C ( 10 mg/m2 ) , vinblastine ( 6 mg/m2 ) , and cisplatin ( 100 mg/m2 ) ( MVP ) chemotherapy in the other arm . We assigned 57 resected patients with pathologic proven stage II non-small cell lung cancer to the groups according to our eligibility criteria . The most common pattern of recurrence was distant metastases , and nearly all the recurrences ( 17 of 18 patients ) in both groups were found within 2 years after operation . The rates of the locoregional and distant metastases were 3.6 % and 46.4 % in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 6.9 % and 10.3 % in the adjuvant chemotherapy group ( p = 0.018 ) . The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 52.0 % in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 74.0 % in the adjuvant chemotherapy group ( p = 0.16 , log-rank test ) . The 2-year , 5-year , and 6-year survival portions were 60.3 % , 56.5 % , and 28.3 % in the adjuvant radiotherapy group , and 82.8 % , 70.1 % , and 60.1 % in the adjuvant chemotherapy group ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.17 , and p = 0.03 , Z-test ) . The difference of the actuarial survival between these two groups was somewhat significant ( p = 0.09 , log-rank test ) . Our results suggest that the addition of adjuvant MVP chemotherapy may reduce the distant metastasis rates and prolong the survival of the surgically resected stage II non-small-cell lung cancer patients . \" \n",

Over a 23-month period , 17 patients scheduled for thermal ablation were prospectively enrolled in this study . The mean age was 72 years ( range , 60-84 years ) . Seven patients were women . Patients were randomized to EM navigation ( n = 7 ) or CT fluoroscopy alone ( n = 10 ) . In some cases , additional ablation or biopsies were performed with or without EM navigation depending on the randomization arm . All procedures were performed under general anesthesia either by a thoracic surgeon or a radiologist . A total of 23 procedures were performed in 17 patients : 20 were ablation procedures and 3 were biopsies . Fourteen were performed for non-small cell lung cancer , and 9 for pulmonary metastases from other organs . Despite randomization , patients receiving EM navigation had a trend for smaller tumors ( mean diameter , 1.45 vs 2.90 cm ; P = 0.06 ) . For thermal ablation procedures , the time to complete intervention was significantly less when EM navigation was used ( mean , 7.6 vs 19 minutes ; P = 0.022 ) . Although not statistically significant , there were fewer skin punctures ( mean , 1 vs 1.25 ; P = 0.082 ) , fewer adjustments ( mean , 5.6 vs 11.8 ; P = 0.203 ) , less CT fluoroscopy time ( mean , 21.3 vs 34.3 seconds ; P = 0.345 ) , and fewer CT scans ( mean , 7 vs 15 ; P = 0.204 ) whenever EM navigation was used . Electromagnetic navigation reduces the time to successfully place an ablation probe in a target tumor . Further study is required to determine whether EM navigation may also reduce the number of adjustments , skin punctures , and CT scans as well as decrease CT fluoroscopy time . \" \n",

We conducted a prospective , multicenter , randomized , controlled , clinical trial with 215 patients followed until death or study closure . The primary outcome measures were dysphagia , quality of life ( QL ) 6 weeks following treatment , and total cost of treatment . Secondary outcome measures included treatment-associated morbidity , mortality , survival , and cost-effectiveness . An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out . There was a significant difference in mean dysphagia grade between treatment arms 6 weeks following treatment ( P = 0.046 ) , with worse swallowing reported by rigid stent-treated patients ( mean dysphagia score difference = -0.49 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -0.10 to -0.89 , P = 0.014 ) . Global QL scores were lower at both 1 and 6 weeks following treatment for patients treated by SEMSs ( mean difference QL index week 1 = -0.66 ; 95 % CI : -0.02 to -1.30 , P = 0.04 ; mean difference QL index week 6 = -1.01 ; 95 % CI -0.30 to -1.72 , P = 0.006 ) . These findings were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores in the SEMS patient group ( mean difference of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C-30 pain symptom score at week 1 = 11.13 ; 95 % CI : 2.89-19 .4 ; P = 0.01 ) . Although mean EQ-5D QL values differed between the treatments ( P < 0.001 ) , this difference dissipated following generation of quality-adjusted life year values . Total costs varied between treatment arms but these findings canceled out when SEMSs were compared with non-SEMS therapies ( 95 % CI -845.15 -1,332.62 ) . These results were robust to sensitivity analysis . There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates , but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting ( risk ratio = 2.47 ; 95 % CI 1.88-3 .04 ) . There was a survival advantage for non-stent-treated patients ( log-rank statistic = 4.21 , P = 0.04 ) .

However , these are not the more sensitive tests for detecting renal damage . This study assessed the effects of low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia on renal function using not only BUN and serum creatinine but also creatinine clearance and urinary excretion of kidney-specific enzymes , and it compared these values with those obtained in high-flow sevoflurane anesthesia and low-flow isoflurane anesthesia . Forty-eight patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy were studied . Patients were randomized to receive sevoflurane anesthesia with fresh gas flow of 1 l/min ( low-flow sevoflurane group ; n = 16 ) or 6-10 l/min ( high-flow sevoflurane group ; n = 16 ) or isoflurane anesthesia with a fresh gas flow of 1 l/min ( low-flow isoflurane group ; n = 16 ) . In all groups , the carrier gas was oxygen/nitrous oxide in the ratio adjusted to ensure a fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired gas ( FiO2 ) of more than 0.3 . Fresh Baralyme was used in the low-flow sevoflurane and low-flow isoflurane groups . Glass balls were used instead in the high-flow sevoflurane group , with the fresh gas flow rate adjusted to eliminate rebreathing . The compound A concentration was measured by gas chromatography . Gas samples taken from the inspiratory limb of the circle system at 1-h intervals were analyzed . Blood samples were obtained before and on days 1 , 2 , and 3 after anesthesia to measure BUN and serum creatinine . Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected before anesthesia and for each 24-h period from 0 to 72 h after anesthesia to measure creatinine , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase , and alanine aminopeptidase . The average inspired concentration of compound A was 20 + / - 7.8 ppm ( mean + / - SD ) , and the average duration of exposure to this concentration was 6.11 + / - 1.77 h in the low-flow sevoflurane group . Postanesthesia BUN and serum creatinine concentrations decreased , creatinine clearance increased , and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alanine aminopeptidase excretion increased in all groups compared with preanesthesia values , but there were no significant differences between the low-flow sevoflurane , high-flow sevoflurane , and low-flow isoflurane groups for any renal function parameter at any time after anesthesia . The only difference between the low-flow and high-flow sevoflurane groups was compound A formation , and postanesthesia laboratory data showed no significant effects of compound A formation during sevoflurane anesthesia on renal function . No significant effects on renal function were observed in either the low-flow or high-flow sevoflurane groups compared with the low-flow isoflurane group . \" \n",

Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival . The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00484939 . From July 9 , 2007 , to Dec 14 , 2010 , 280 patients with a median age of 76 years ( range 70-87 ) were recruited from 40 sites across ten countries . Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bevacizumab plus capecitabine ( n = 140 ) or capecitabine only ( n = 140 ) . Progression-free survival was significantly longer with bevacizumab and capecitabine than with capecitabine alone ( median 91 months  95 % CI 73-114  vs 51 months  42-63  ; hazard ratio 053  041-069  ; p < 00001 ) . Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 53 ( 40 % ) patients in the combination group and 30 ( 22 % ) in the capecitabine group , and treatment-related serious adverse events in 19 ( 14 % ) and 11 ( 8 % ) patients . The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events of special interest for bevacizumab or chemotherapy were hand-foot syndrome ( 21  16 %  vs nine  7 %  ) , diarrhoea ( nine  7 %  vs nine  7 %  ) , and venous thromboembolic events ( 11  8 %  vs six  4 %  ) . Treatment-related deaths occurred in five patients in the combination group and four in the capecitabine group . The most common any-grade adverse event of special interest for bevacizumab was haemorrhage ( 34  25 %  vs nine  7 %  ) . The combination of bevacizumab and capecitabine is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer . F Hoffmann-La Roche . \" \n",

More recently coloplasty has been advocated as an alternative to a colonic pouch . However there have been no long-term randomized , controlled trials to compare functional outcomes of coloplasty , colonic J-Pouch ( JP ) , or a straight anastomosis ( SA ) after the treatment of low rectal cancer . : To compare the complications , long-term functional outcome , and quality of life ( QOL ) of patients undergoing a coloplasty , JP , or an SA in reconstruction of the lower gastrointestinal tract after proctectomy for low rectal cancer . A multicenter study enrolled patients with low rectal cancer , who were randomized intraoperatively to coloplasty ( CP-1 ) or SA if JP was not feasible , or JP or coloplasty ( CP-2 ) if a JP was feasible . Patients were followed for 24 months with SF-36 surveys to evaluate the QOL . Bowel function was measured quantitatively and using Fecal Incontinence Severity Index ( FISI ) . Urinary function and sexual function were also assessed . Three hundred sixty-four patients were randomized . All patients were evaluated for complications and recurrence . Mean age was 60 + / -12 years , 71 % were male . Twenty-three ( 7.4 % ) died within 24 months of surgery . No significant difference was observed in the complications among the 4 groups . Two hundred ninety-seven of 364 were evaluated for functional outcome at 24 months . There was no difference in bowel function between the CP-1 and SA groups . JP patients had fewer bowel movements , less clustering , used fewer pads and had a lower FISI than the CP-2 group . Other parameters were not statistically different . QOL scores at 24 months were similar for each of the 4 groups . In patients undergoing a restorative resection for low rectal cancer , a colonic JP offers significant advantages in function over an SA or a coloplasty . In patients who can not have a pouch , coloplasty seems not to improve the bowel function of patients over that with an SA . \" \n",

Exemestane 25 mg orally was administered once daily . A total of 693 women were randomly assigned to fulvestrant ( n = 351 ) or exemestane ( n = 342 ) . Approximately 60 % of patients had received at least two prior endocrine therapies . Median TTP was 3.7 months in both groups ( hazard ratio = 0.963 ; 95 % CI , 0.819 to 1.133 ; P = .6531 ) . The overall response rate ( 7.4 % v 6.7 % ; P = .736 ) and clinical benefit rate ( 32.2 % v 31.5 % ; P = .853 ) were similar between fulvestrant and exemestane respectively . Median duration of clinical benefit was 9.3 and 8.3 months , respectively . Both treatments were well tolerated , with no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events or quality of life . Pharmacokinetic data confirm that steady-state was reached within 1 month with the LD schedule of fulvestrant . Fulvestrant LD and exemestane are equally active and well-tolerated in a meaningful proportion of postmenopausal women with ABC who have experienced progression or recurrence during treatment with a nonsteroidal AI . \" \n",

Full body skin examination as opposed to examination of sun-exposed areas offers several advantages , including the opportunity to diagnose early melanoma in areas normally covered by clothing . Disadvantages of full body skin examination include patient resistance because of inconvenience and concerns about privacy and modesty . The additional time involved in full body skin examination may also be an impediment . In a randomized double-armed study , we studied whether patients were more likely to develop a positive attitude towards full body skin examination if they were advised beforehand , in writing , of the logic underlying the need for a complete examination . Patients presenting to a public skin cancer screening were divided into two groups . Group A ( N = 111 ) received a written explanation of the need for full body skin examination and Group B ( N = 175 ) received no information . Patients were then surveyed , after the screening , about their attitudes towards full body skin examination . Those who received pre-education were less likely ( P < .05 ) to be concerned about a genital examination . Those who were concerned about a genital exam were compared with those who were not concerned about a genital exam , the former patients were : 1 ) younger ( P < .05 ) ; 2 ) more concerned about privacy ( P < .001 ) ; and 3 ) preferred a physician of the same sex ( P < .001 ) . Providing patients with information about the need for full body skin examination decreases concern about undergoing a skin genital exam and may minimize resistance to full body skin examination in public skin cancer screenings . \" \n",

In the control arm , CP is replaced by saline solution and L-BLP25 by placebo . Primary endpoint is the comparison of recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) time between groups . Secondary endpoints are overall survival ( OS ) time , safety , tolerability , RFS/OS in MUC-1 positive cancers . Exploratory immune response analyses are planned . The primary endpoint will be assessed in Q3 2016 . Follow-up will end Q3 2017 . Interim analyses are not planned .

Approximately 75 % of patients in both arms received second-line therapy ; 58 % of rIFL patients received oxaliplatin-based second-line therapy , and 55 % of FOLFOX4 patients received irinotecan-based regimens as second-line therapy . FOLFOX4 led to superior RR , time to progression , and overall survival compared with rIFL . The survival benefit for FOLFOX4 observed in the earlier stage of the study was preserved with equal use of either irinotecan or oxaliplatin as second-line therapy . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Extended systemic lymphadenectomy ( D2 ) is standard procedure for surgical treatment of advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) although less extensive lymphadenectomy ( D1 ) can be applied to early gastric cancer . Complete D2 lymphadenectomy is the mandatory procedure for studies that evaluate surgical treatment results of AGC . However , the actual extent of D2 lymphadenectomy varies among surgeons because of a lacking consensus on the anatomical definition of each lymph node station . This study is aimed to develop a consensus for D2 lymphadenectomy and also to qualify surgeons that can perform both laparoscopic and open D2 gastrectomy . This ( KLASS-02-QC ) is a prospective , observational , multicenter study to qualify the surgeons that will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT , which is a prospective , randomized , clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open gastrectomy for AGC . Surgeons and reviewers participating in the study will be required to complete a questionnaire detailing their professional experience and specific gastrectomy surgical background/training , and the gastrectomy metrics of their primary hospitals . All surgeons must submit three laparoscopic and three open D2 gastrectomy videos , respectively . Each video will be allocated to five peer reviewers ; thus each surgeon s operations will be assessed by a total of 30 reviews ., Based on blinded assessment of unedited videos by experts review , a separate review evaluation committee will decide whether or not the evaluated surgeon will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT ., The primary outcome measure is each surgeon s proficiency , as assessed by the reviewers based on evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy ., We believe that our study for standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control ( KLASS-02-QC ) will guarantee successful implementation of the subsequent KLASS-02-RCT study . After making consensus on D2 lymphadenectomy , we developed evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy . We also developed a unique surgical standardization and quality control system that consists of recording unedited surgical videos , and expert review according to evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy . We hope our systematic approach will set a milestone in surgical standardization that is essential for surgical clinical trials . Additionally , our methods will serve as a novel system for educating surgeons and assessing surgical proficiency . NCT01283893 . \" \n",

This community-based intervention study employed a quasiexperimental delayed-control ( crossover ) design with randomization at the church level . Forty-five African American churches were randomly assigned to two study groups : early intervention and delayed intervention . A convenience sample of 430 African American male volunteers ( ages 40-70 ) was enrolled through the churches , and 350 men remained in the study through wave 3 . The intervention was a culturally tailored group educational program , which included a video and a question-and-answer session with an African American physician . Within each group , knowledge , perceived threat , and screening prevalence all increased significantly . However , the magnitude of increases was similar , so the groups did not differ significantly at wave 2 . Knowledge at wave 2 was associated with greater odds of having a digital rectal exam by wave 3 only for the early-intervention group . The early-intervention group was two times more likely to have talked to a physician about prostate cancer screening by wave 3 . The findings suggest that the delayed-intervention group did not function as a pure control and may have unintentionally received a partial intervention . This finding demonstrated that a low-cost prostate cancer awareness campaign within a church may be enough to affect prostate cancer knowledge , attitudes , and behaviors among African American men . Further research should examine the church-specific intervention elements , cultural appropriateness of the messages , and whether group sessions provide additional effect . \" \n",

All the patients received four 21-day cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide . We randomly assigned these patients to receive a total of 45 Gy of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy , given either twice daily over a three-week period or once daily over a period of five weeks . Twice-daily treatment beginning with the first cycle of chemotherapy significantly improved survival as compared with concurrent once-daily radiotherapy ( P = 0.04 by the log-rank test ) . After a median follow-up of almost 8 years , the median survival was 19 months for the once-daily group and 23 months for the twice-daily group . The survival rates for patients receiving once-daily radiotherapy were 41 percent at two years and 16 percent at five years . For patients receiving twice-daily radiotherapy , the survival rates were 47 percent at two years and 26 percent at five years . Grade 3 esophagitis was significantly more frequent with twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy , occurring in 27 percent of patients , as compared with 11 percent in the once-daily group ( P < 0.001 ) .

Therefore , 2 large randomized trials that involved pemetrexed were retrospectively analyzed to determine the pattern of symptomatic relapse in the brain and to gauge if pemetrexed could influence the incidence . Two large phase III studies of pemetrexed in advanced NSCLC were included . One study compared pemetrexed with docetaxel in previously treated patients ( n = 571 ) ; the other study tested cisplatin plus pemetrexed vs. cisplatin plus gemcitabine in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC ( n = 1725 ) . Patients with known BM at study entry were excluded from this analysis . Each study was analyzed separately , then jointly to determine the rate of BM reported as the only site of progressive disease by treatment group and histology . Logistic regression was used to obtain an odds ratio for the treatment effect on the overall occurrence of BM while controlling for potential confounding factors . Overall , 71.5 % of patients in pemetrexed-containing arms ( 819 of 1145 ) , and 68.2 % of patients in non-pemetrexed-containing arms ( 785 of 1151 ) experienced progressive disease . BM recurrence rates were 3.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 2.1 % -4.6 % ) in the pemetrexed-containing arms vs. 6.6 % ( 95 % CI , 5.0 % -8.6 % ) in the non-pemetrexed-containing arms ( P = .002 ) . The odds ratio for BM recurrence associated with exposure to pemetrexed was 0.49 ( 95 % CI , 0.32-0 .76 ; P = .001 ) . The beneficial effect of pemetrexed on BM was confined to patients with nonsquamous NSCLC . Patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC treated with pemetrexed either in first-line or second-line therapy may reduce the risk of developing BM as the first site of progressive disease . This retrospective analysis is limited due to the lack of baseline and periodic brain scans , and it reflects symptomatic BM only . Regardless , these findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of pemetrexed-based treatments on the control of BM . \" \n",

Over the last 30years , the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma has risen continuously worldwide . Meanwhile , the intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma has become more common than the extrahepatic growth type and currently accounts for 10-15 % of all primary hepatic malignancies . Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma is typically diagnosed in advanced stages due to late clinical symptoms and an absence of classic risk factors . A late diagnosis precludes curative surgical resection . There is evidence that transarterial chemoembolization leads to better local tumor control and prolongs survival compared to systemic chemotherapy . New data indicates that selective internal radiotherapy , also referred to as radioembolization , provides promising results for treating intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma . This pilot study is a randomized , controlled , single center , phase II trial . Twenty-four patients with intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either chemoembolization or radioembolization . Randomization will be stratified according to tumor load . Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint ; overall survival and time to progression are secondary endpoints . To evaluate treatment success , patients will receive contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging every 3months . Currently , chemoembolization is routinely performed in many centers instead of systemic chemotherapy for treating intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma confined to the liver . Recently , radioembolization has been increasingly applied to cholangiocellular carcinoma as second line therapy after TACE failure or even as an alternative first line therapy . Nonetheless , no randomized studies have compared radioembolization and chemoembolization . Considering all this background information , we recognized a strong need for a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) to compare the two treatments . Therefore , the present protocol describes the design of a RCT that compares SIRT and TACE as the first line therapy for inoperable CCC confined to the liver .

The most frequently reported cardiac disorder was ischemic heart disease , which occurred in 4 % of subjects treated with degarelix and 10 % of those on leuprolide . Cox proportional hazard ratio estimates for selected baseline covariates showed a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events by age ( p = 0.0459 ) and systolic blood pressure ( p = 0.0061 ) . In men with prostate cancer degarelix and leuprolide have similar cardiovascular safety profiles . These observations suggest that the cardiovascular events associated with both agents result from hypogonadism rather than a direct drug effect . \" \n",

A multicenter randomized phase II trial was conducted to test whether immunization with modified HLA class I tumor peptides in the context of adjuvant therapy results in better immunologic responses and improved clinical outcomes in patients with early melanoma ( stages IIB/C-III ) . Forty-three patients were enrolled to undergo vaccination ( n = 22 ) or observation ( n = 21 ) . The vaccine included four HLA-A * 0201-restricted modified peptides ( Melan-A/MART -1 (  27L  ) , gp100 (  210M  ) , NY-ESO-1 (  165V  ) , and Survivin (  97M  ) ) emulsified in Montanide ISA51 and injected subcutaneously in combination with cyclophosphamide ( 300 mg/m ( 2 ) ) and low-dose IL-2 ( 3 10 ( 6 ) IU ) . The immune responses were monitored using ex vivo IFN -- ELISpot , HLA/multimer staining , and in vitro short-term peptide sensitization assays . Vaccination induced a rapid and persistent increase in specific effector memory CD8 ( + ) T cells in 75 % of the patients . However , this immunization was not associated with any significant increase in disease-free or overall survival as compared with the observation group . An extensive immunologic analysis revealed a significantly reduced cross-recognition of the corresponding native peptides and , most importantly , a limited ability to react to melanoma cells . Adjuvant setting is an appealing approach for testing cancer vaccines because specific CD8 ( + ) T cells can be efficiently induced in most vaccinated patients . However , the marginal antitumor activity of the T cells induced by modified peptides in this study largely accounts for the observed lack of benefit of vaccination . These findings suggest reconsidering this immunization strategy , particularly in early disease . \" \n",

Third party payer point of view was applied to measure and value the cost of treatments . Cost data were extracted from hospital and health insurance organizations . Robustness of the results was checked through a two way sensitivity analysis . TAC was associated with higher deterioration in HRQoL during treatment and higher improvements over 4 months follow-up . On average , the cost of treatment per patient in TAC was 15 times higher than FAC ( p < .001 ) . In overall , TAC was resulted in lower QALYs and higher cost over study period .

ER , progesterone receptor ( PR ) status and HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray . HER2 amplification was analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and tumours being amplified and/or HER2 3 + were considered HER2 + . HER2 status was evaluable in 83 % of the patients and 12.6 % were HER2 + . In untreated patients , HER2 was a negative prognostic factor in ER + patients , HR 2.95 ; 95 % CI : 1.61-5 .38 , p < 0.001 , but not in ER - patients , HR 0.67 ; 95 % CI : 0.28-1 .61 , p = 0.4 , and a significant interaction between the two markers was found , p < 0.01 . HER2 status was not related to tamoxifen treatment efficacy in ER + patients ( term of interaction p = 0.95 ) . When stratifying for PR status , similar results were achieved . HER2 + and ER + breast cancer constituted a subgroup of tumours with poor prognosis in premenopausal breast cancer , whereas no treatment interaction was found between HER2 status and tamoxifen in ER + tumours . The poor prognosis in HER2 + and ER + patients may interfere with the interpretation of HER2 data in non-randomised trials of adjuvant tamoxifen . \" \n",

The therapeutic regimen consisted of ( 1 ) estrogen suppression by aminoglutethimide ( AGL ) 1 g/d plus hydrocortisone ( HC ) 40 mg/d , with surgical castration performed on premenopausal patients ; ( 2 ) fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) 500 mg/m2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 , and cyclophosphamide ( CPA ) 500 mg/m2 ( FAC ) intravenously ( IV ) every 3 weeks ; ( 3 ) following randomization , patients were double-blinded to receive either PL or EE2 50 micrograms exactly 24 hours before receiving FAC . All patients had advanced breast cancer presumably sensitive to endocrine therapy ( estrogen receptor-positive  ER +  and/or progesterone receptor-positive  PgR +  status ) with measurable lesions ; none had received prior systemic antineoplastic therapy for metastatic disease ; prior adjuvant hormonal therapy ( HT ) or CT ( without anthracyclines ) was allowed if interval since completion was longer than 1 year . Among 154 patients treated according to the protocol , tolerance , response rates , time to progression , and median survival duration were identical in the PL and EE2 groups . Only performance status , dominant metastatic site , and menopausal status seemed to influence response ( overall response , 64 % ) , with the highest levels of partial remission ( PR ) and complete remission ( CR ) being achieved in premenopausal women ( CR plus PR , 26 % plus 55 % ) and in those with dominant soft tissue lesions ( CR plus PR , 45 % plus 28 % ) . We conclude that the validity of the hormonal recruitment concept has not yet been established in clinical practice so that this approach remains experimental . The results achieved by combining ( near ) complete estrogenic suppression and cyclical FAC chemotherapy are not significantly different from those to be expected with the more conventional use of HT followed by CT in presumably hormone-responsive ( ER + ) patients . \" \n",

Hypnotherapy did not reduce anxiety or improve the quality of life in cancer patients undergoing curative RT. . The absence of statistically significant differences between the two groups contrasts with the hypnotherapy patients own sense of mental and overall well-being , which was significantly greater after hypnotherapy ., It can not be excluded that the extra attention by the hypnotherapist was responsible for this beneficial effect in the hypnotherapy group .

This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers . All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas ( CMM , N = 28 069 ) and squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC , N = 24 620 ) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included . Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios ( SIR ) . Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer , accounting for residential region , education , income , parenthood , marital status and parental cancer status , using a 20 % random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference . Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers . During follow-up , 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer . SIR analyses showed 50 % and 90 % increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) . The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC ( 130 % ) . The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers , but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess : oral , lung , colon , breast , prostate , thyroid , leukemia , lymphoma and central nervous system . Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex , older age , lower residential latitude , being married and low education and income . Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC , but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors . Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers , which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise . \" \n",

Prior to the supplement study , 5 fasted subjects participated in an acute timecourse experiment and had blood taken at baseline and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 h after consuming walnuts ( 75 g ) . During the timecourse experiment , triglycerides peaked at 4 h , and gamma-tocopherol ( gamma-T ) increased from 4 to 8 h. Triglyceride - normalized gamma-T was two-fold higher ( P = 0.01 ) after 8 versus 4 h. In the supplement study , change from baseline was +0.83 + / - 0.52 micromol/L for gamma-T , -2.65 + / - 1.30 micromol/L for alpha-tocopherol ( alpha-T ) and -3.49 + / - 1.99 for the tocopherol ratio ( alpha-T : gamma-T ) . A linear mixed model showed that , although PSA did not change , the ratio of free PSA : total PSA increased and approached significance ( P = 0.07 ) . The alpha-T : gamma-T ratio decreased significantly ( P = 0.01 ) , partly reflecting an increase in serum gamma-T , which approached significance ( P = 0.08 ) . The significant decrease in the alpha-T : gamma-T ratio with an increase in serum gamma-T and a trend towards an increase in the ratio of free PSA : total PSA following the 8-week supplement study suggest that walnuts may improve biomarkers of prostate and vascular status . \" \n",

Cost and clinical data were used as the basis for modelling the expected costs , and cost savings , resulting from the treatment of screen detected cancers , as compared with cancers detected by symptomatic presentation . Data were derived from the MRC screening trial currently in progress in Nottingham . Approximately 140,000 subjects , age 50-79 years , were randomly allocated to a test ( screened ) and a control ( unscreened ) group . The net costs of detecting and treating a cancer following colorectal screening fall as the age of the target population increases , owing principally to the increasing incidence of the disease with age . Generally , the marginal detection and treatment costs falls for all age groups with the first screening round , but rises considerably with the second . If allowance is made for cancers prevented as a result of early detection and excision of adenomas , the costs of screening are substantially reduced for all age groups . Assuming a cost per QALY ( quality adjusted life year gained ) equivalent to that derived for the breast cancer screening programme , and a QALY gain from colorectal screening of one year , three screens , each separated by two years , appear economically justified for populations aged 60 years and above . Expected gains from cancer prevention make two screens justifiable for those between 45 and 59 years of age . \" \n",

A randomized trial was undertaken to evaluate the impact the addition of methyl-lomustine would have on response , duration of survival , and survival rates in patients with advanced colorectal cancer . The methyl-lomustine/5-FU/Leucovorin ( MFL ) regimen consisted of methyl-lomustine ( 110 mg/m2 ) , administered on Day 1 of each 8-week cycle with six weekly boluses of 5-FU ( 600 mg/m2 ) , and Leucovorin ( 500 mg/m2 ) . The FL treatment arm consisted of the administration of 5-FU and Leucovorin as described above . Patients were evaluated for response and toxicity after each 8-week cycle . Of 319 patients included in this trial , 297 ( 93.1 % ) had disease evaluable for response and toxicity : 145 received MFL , and 152 received FL . In this trial , 526 courses of MFL and 529 courses of FL were administered . Methyl-lomustine/5-FU/Leucovorin treatment resulted in 4 complete and 30 partial responses ( response rate , 21.9 % ) , and FL treatment resulted in 9 complete and 33 partial responses ( response rate , 26.4 % ) . There was no significant difference in median survival duration between patients in the two arms ( MFL = 48 weeks , FL = 51 weeks ) . However , MFL was significantly more toxic with greater myelosuppression than was FL ( Grade 3-4 neutropenia : MFL = 56 patients , FL = 27 patients , P < 0.001 ; Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia : MFL = 49 patients , FL = 2 patients , P < 0.001 ; Grade 3-4 anemia : MFL = 15 patients , FL = 6 patients , P < 0.001 ; and more prolonged median duration of granulocytopenia : MFL = 9 days , FL = 7 days , P < 0.001 ; and thrombocytopenia : MFL = 14 days , FL = 7.5 days , P < 0.001 ) . Because the addition of methyl-lomustine in the MFL schedule markedly increased the toxicity of the regimen and because the FL regimen was as effective as MFL , the authors recommend that Leucovorin and 5-FU remain the treatment choice for treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer . \" \n",

To help document the achievement of palliation and to characterize positive and negative effects of treatment , we evaluated quality-of-life ( QOL ) parameters in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were randomly assigned to two methods of androgen deprivation . Patients ( n = 739 ) with stage M1 ( bone or soft tissue metastasis ) prostate cancer were enrolled in a QOL protocol that was a companion to Southwest Oncology Group INT-0105 , a randomized double-blind trial comparing treatment with bilateral orchiectomy ( surgical castration ) plus either flutamide or placebo . Patients completed a comprehensive battery of QOL questionnaires at random assignment to treatment and at 1 , 3 , and 6 months later . Data were collected on three treatment-specific symptoms ( diarrhea , gas pain , and body image ) , on physical functioning , and on emotional functioning . All P values are two-sided . Questionnaire return rates for this study never dropped below 80 % ; only 2 % of the patients did not submit baseline QOL assessments . Cross-sectional analyses ( corrected for multiple testing ) identified statistically significant differences that favored orchiectomy plus placebo for two of the five primary QOL parameters as follows : patients receiving flutamide reported more diarrhea at 3 months ( P = .001 ) and worse emotional functioning at 3 and 6 months ( both P < .003 ) . Longitudinal analyses replicated these findings . Other analyzed QOL parameters favored the group receiving placebo but were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing . We found a consistent pattern of better QOL outcomes at each follow-up assessment during the first 6 months of treatment for orchiectomized patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received placebo versus flutamide . Improvement over time was evident in both treatment groups but more so for patients receiving placebo . \" \n",

The aim of this study was to compare the safety profiles and recovery scores propofol continuous infusion and intermittent midazolam ( MDZ ) injection as sedation for ESD . Sixty EGC patients scheduled for ESDs between August and November 2008 were included in this prospective study and randomly divided into a propofol ( P-group , 28 patients ) and an MDZ ( M-group , 32 patients ) group using an odd-even system . The P-group received a 0.8 mg/kg induction dose and a 3 mg/kg/h maintenance dose of 1 % propofol using an infusion pump . All patients received 15 mg pentazocine at the start of the ESD and at 60-min intervals thereafter . We recorded and analyzed blood pressure , oxygen saturation and heart rate during and following the procedure and evaluated post-anesthetic recovery scores ( PARS ) and subsequent alertness scores . The propofol maintenance and total dose amounts were ( mean + / - standard deviation ) 3.7 + / - 0.6 mg/kg/h and 395 + / - 202 mg , respectively . The mean total dose of MDZ was 10.3 + / - 4.5 mg . There were no cases of de-saturation < 90 % or hypotension < 80 mmHg in either group . Alertness scores 15 and 60 min after the procedures were significantly higher in the P-group ( 4.9 / 4.9 ) than in the M-group ( 4.6 / 4.5 ; p < 0.05 ) . The mean PARS 15 and 30 min after the ESDs were significantly higher in the P-group ( 9.6 / 9.9 ) than in the M-group ( 8.6 / 9.2 ; p < 0.01 ) . Based on our results , the ESDs for EGC performed under sedation using propofol continuous infusion were as safe as those performed using intermittent MDZ injection . Propofol-treated patients had a quicker recovery profile than those treated with MDZ . We therefore recommend the use of continuous propofol sedation for ESD , but sedation guidelines for the use of propofol are necessary . \" \n",

Cancer immunotherapy has been attractive since a long time , with diverse clinical attempts and results . In particular , natural killer ( NK ) cells have received considerable attention because of their potential role in immune surveillance in vivo by destroying infected or transformed cells . Major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A/B ( MICA/B ) on tumor cells , known as the representative ligand for NKG2D receptor on NK cells , has been reported to be modulated by a variety of stress factors , including some chemotherapeutic agents , and it is anticipated that enhancing MICA/B expression will be contributory to anticancer treatment . With recent development of expanding autologous ex vivo NK cell-enriched lymphocytes ( NKL ) , we designed a trial to augment the anticancer effect by co-administering NKL and docetaxel , one of the second-line agents used for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Eligible patients were between the age of 20 and 75 years , with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) of 0 to 2 , and previously received one chemotherapy or two regimens including one epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor , stage IIIB/IV , histologically - or cytologically-proven NSCLC with measurable lesions . NKL were kindly prepared and provided from NKBIO Co. ( Seongnam City , Korea ) . Feasibility , adverse effects , progression-free survival ( PFS ) were evaluated and compared with the historical control of weekly docetaxel regimen . Nineteen patients were enrolled before early closure . NKL production and administration were feasible in all cases , even in those with disseminated disease . No additional adverse events were observed in addition to those reported for docetaxel-alone . PFS of 3 months and 10.5 % response rate ( RR ) , with two cases of partial response , were observed and were similar to the historical control ( PFS = 2.9 months , RR = 8.0 % ) . To our knowledge , this is the first report on the combination of NKL with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC . Autologous NKL production and co-administration with docetaxel were feasible without further toxicity or complication . Benefit in PFS and RR , as compared with the historical control , was not detected in this study population with advanced NSCLC . In order to determine whether the combination of NKL and chemotherapy has any anticancer effect , an additional study should be performed in patients with low tumor burden , such as those with less advanced disease or those in remission . \" \n",

Twenty four patients were randomized to treatment cohorts of 5 , 15 or 25 mcg/m2 of Bryostatin-1 on days 1 , 8 and 15 , starting in the second cycle . An additional nine , non-randomized patients were given 35 mcg/m2 . Lymphocytes were analyzed for number , activation status , and production of IL-2 , IL-4 and IFN-gamma . Response evaluation was performed every 3 cycles . Common grade 3 toxicities included fatigue ( 5 ) , nausea/vomiting ( 5 ) , myopathy ( 3 ) , dyspnea ( 3 ) , and syncope ( 3 ) . Four patients , in the two highest dose cohorts , demonstrated evidence of tumor shrinkage , although there was only 1 objective PR . The median time to progression was 104 days ( 95 % CI 88-120 ) and the median survival was 452 days ( 95 % CI = 424-480 ) . There was no significant boosting effect of Bryostatin-1 on lymphocytes . The addition of Bryostatin-1 to IL-2 was well tolerated , but the overall response rate was low ( 3.2 % ) , indicating that further studies with this combination are not warranted . \" \n",

However , approximately 30 % of affected patients present new disease manifestations within 10 years after surgery . To test the hypothesis that node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy , a prospective randomized study was activated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan in 1980 . The study was conducted in 90 patients operated on for unilateral breast cancer who were then assigned to receive either 12 intravenous cycles of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) every three weeks , or no further treatment . Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology . Patient characteristics were fairly well balanced between the two treatment groups except for primary tumor size : 58 % of those with a primary tumor measuring > 2 cm in its largest diameter were randomized in the control group compared with 38 % in the CMF regimen ( P = 0.06 ) . At 12 years after surgery treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients given adjuvant CMF . The relapse-free survival rate was 71 % ( 95 % confidence limits ( CL ) : 56-86 ) versus 43 % ( 95 % CL : 28-58 ) , and total survival was 80 % ( 95 % CL : 68-92 ) versus 50 % ( 95 % CL : 34-66 ) , respectively . The benefit from the administration of CMF was evident in all patient subsets and was not influenced by menopausal status .

In this study , we evaluated HER-2 and topo IIalpha gene aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization in a series of 430 primary breast cancer samples . Samples came from node-positive breast cancer patients randomly treated either with one of two anthracycline-based regimens  full-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide ( HEC ) and moderate-dose epirubicin-cyclophosphamide ( EC )  or with cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and 5-fluorouracil ( CMF ) in the context of a Phase III adjuvant therapy trial . Event-free survival comparisons were performed between the three study arms in the subgroups of HER-2-amplified and nonamplified tumors . An explorative analysis was also performed to evaluate the predictive value of topo IIalpha in the cohort of HER-2-amplified patients . HER-2 amplification was observed in 73 of the 354 evaluable samples ( 21 % ) , whereas topo IIalpha amplification was found in 23 of the 61 evaluable HER-2-amplified tumors ( 38 % ) . The three event-free survival comparisons were CMF versus HEC , CMF versus EC , and EC versus HEC . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were as follows : ( a ) CMF versus HEC , HR = 1.42 for HER-2-amplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.54-3 .76 ; P = 0.48 ) and 0.84 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.49-1 .44 ; P = 0.53 ) ; ( b ) CMF versus EC , HR = 1.65 for HER-2-amplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.66-4 .13 ; P = 0.29 ) and 0.66 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.39-1 .10 ; P = 0.11 ) ; and ( c ) EC versus HEC , HR = 0.93 for HER-2-amplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.31-2 .77 , P = 0.90 ) and 1.33 for HER-2-nonamplified tumors ( 95 % CI , 0.82-2 .14 ; P = 0.25 ) . Observed HRs suggest that the anthracycline-based therapy could be more effective than CMF in the subgroup of HER-2-amplified patients , whereas treatments could be equally active in the HER-2-nonamplified cohort . topo IIalpha evaluation suggests that the superiority of anthracyclines over CMF in HER-2-amplified patients could be confined to the subgroup of topo IIalpha-amplified tumors . HER-2 could have a predictive value for the activity of anthracycline-based regimens in the adjuvant therapy of breast cancer patients . The predictive value of HER-2 would most likely be related to the concomitant amplification of the topo IIalpha gene . \" \n",

In the first stage , we screened for mutations by sequencing the HOXB13 coding region in 96 unrelated PCa patients . In stage 2 , G84E and novel mutations found in stage 1 were genotyped in 671 PCa patients and 1,536 controls . In stage 3 , mutation status in 751 additional PCa patients was imputed via haplotype . The G84E mutation was not detected in this study . However , a novel mutation , G135E , was identified among 96 patients in stage 1 . It was also observed twice in 575 additional PCa patients but not in 1,536 control subjects of stage 2 . The frequency of G135E was significantly different between cases and controls , with a P-value of 0.027 , based on Fisher s exact test ., Haplotype estimation showed that G135E mutation carriers shared a unique haplotype that was not observed in other subjects . In stage 3 , two more PCa patients were predicted to carry the G135E mutation . We identified a novel rare mutation in the HOXB13 gene , G135E , which appears to be a founder mutation . This mutation is associated with increased PCa risk in Chinese men .

We retrospectively assessed biological factors in a subgroup of 285 GRISO cases ( 145 given axillary radiotherapy ; 140 not given axillary radiotherapy ) with complete biologic , therapeutic and follow-up information , using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modelling . Only 10-year cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was lower in the axillary radiotherapy ( 1 % ) than no axillary radiotherapy arm ( 7 % ) ( p = 0.037 ) . Irrespective of study arm , hormone receptor positivity had significantly favourable effects on 10-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival . human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) - positive and triple-negative subtypes were associated with lower 10-year DFS ( 60 % and 76 % , respectively ) than luminal A ( 96 % ) and B ( 91 % ) ( p = 0.001 ) . Ten-year DFS for high ( 14 % ) Ki67 cancers was lower than for low Ki67 cancers ( p = 0.027 ) ; however , this effect was mainly confined to the no axillary radiotherapy arm . For patients with clinically node-negative small breast cancer not given axillary dissection , 10-year DFS is worsened by HER2 positivity , triple-negative phenotype and high Ki67 .

Decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen level after 3 months of therapy were also similar in both groups : 94 % with the 10.8-mg depot and 92.5 % with the 3.6-mg depot . For all patients , the median time to progression was 152.7 weeks and the median time to death was 213.6 weeks . The safety profile of the 10.8-mg goserelin acetate depot was similar to that of the 3.6-mg depot ; hot flashes was the most common adverse event . The incidence of injection site reactions was very low ( 2  0.3 %  of 614 administrations ) . The new 10.8-mg depot was pharmacodynamically equivalent to the current 3.6-mg depot and was well tolerated , both locally and systemically . The observed times to progression and survival were as expected in this patient population . The 10.8-mg goserelin-acetate depot provided a dosing schedule that was convenient for the patient and the physician , and it has the potential to reduce health care costs while maintaining the quality of life in patients being treated for advanced prostate cancer . \" \n",

Patients with an education beyond the 10th-grade level were not formally accessed in this study . Because of this , we could not evaluate whether differences in educational attainment affected patient understanding of endoscopy procedure details and findings .

We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity . Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer ( uT3/4 or uN + , Mason CS III/IV ) were randomly assigned to pre - or postoperative radiochemotherapy : A total dose of 50.4 Gy ( single dose 1.8 Gy ) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes . 5-FU ( 1,000 mg/m2/d ) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion . Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy ( 500 mg/m2/d , i.v. bolus ) were applied . Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting . Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms . Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision . In addition , stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for . Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival , local and distant control , secondary endpoints include rate of curative ( R0 ) resections and sphincter saving procedures , toxicity of radiochemotherapy , surgical complications and quality of life . As of 15th November 2000 , 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions : 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy , 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy . Acute toxicity ( WHO ) of radiochemotherapy was low , with less than 15 % of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity : The principal toxicity was diarrhea , with 12 % in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10 % in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3 , and 1 % in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea . Erythema , nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities , with less than 3 % of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea . Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms , with 12 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 13 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) of patients , respectively , suffering from anastomotic leakage , 4 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 3 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from postoperative bleeding , and 6 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 5 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from delayed wound healing .

Patients with platinum-sensitive ROC ( recurrence 6 months after front-line platinum-based therapy ) and measurable disease were randomly assigned to GC plus either BV or placebo ( PL ) for six to 10 cycles . BV or PL , respectively , was then continued until disease progression . The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) by RECIST ; secondary end points were objective response rate , duration of response ( DOR ) , overall survival , and safety . Overall , 484 patients were randomly assigned . PFS for the BV arm was superior to that for the PL arm ( hazard ratio  HR  , 0.484 ; 95 % CI , 0.388 to 0.605 ; log-rank P < .0001 ) ; median PFS was 12.4 v 8.4 months , respectively . The objective response rate ( 78.5 % v 57.4 % ; P < .0001 ) and DOR ( 10.4 v 7.4 months ; HR , 0.534 ; 95 % CI , 0.408 to 0.698 ) were significantly improved with the addition of BV . No new safety concerns were noted . Grade 3 or higher hypertension ( 17.4 % v < 1 % ) and proteinuria ( 8.5 % v < 1 % ) occurred more frequently in the BV arm . The rates of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were similar in both arms . Two patients in the BV arm experienced GI perforation after study treatment discontinuation . GC plus BV followed by BV until progression resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared with GC plus PL in platinum-sensitive ROC . \" \n",

In this prespecified analysis , we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens . From 1999 to 2002 , women with completely excised invasive breast cancer ( pT1-3a , pN0-1 , M0 ) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres . Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment ( where prescribed ) . Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre , type of primary surgery ( breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy ) , and tumour bed boost radiotherapy . In START-A , a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 416 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks . In START-B , a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks . Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction . Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects . Analysis was by intention to treat . Follow-up data are still being collected . This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN59368779 . START-A enrolled 2236 women . Median follow-up was 93 years ( IQR 80-100 ) , after which 139 local-regional relapses had occurred . 10-year rates of local-regional relapse did not differ significantly between the 416 Gy and 50 Gy regimen groups ( 63 % , 95 % CI 47-85 vs 74 % , 55-100 ; hazard ratio  HR  091 , 95 % CI 059-138 ; p = 065 ) or the 39 Gy ( 88 % , 95 % CI 67-114 ) and 50 Gy regimen groups ( HR 118 , 95 % CI 079-176 ; p = 041 ) . In START-A , moderate or marked breast induration , telangiectasia , and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group . Normal tissue effects did not differ significantly between 416 Gy and 50 Gy groups . START-B enrolled 2215 women . Median follow-up was 99 years ( IQR 75-101 ) , after which 95 local-regional relapses had occurred . The proportion of patients with local-regional relapse at 10 years did not differ significantly between the 40 Gy group ( 43 % , 95 % CI 32-59 ) and the 50 Gy group ( 55 % , 95 % CI 42-72 ; HR 077 , 95 % CI 051-116 ; p = 021 ) . In START-B , breast shrinkage , telangiectasia , and breast oedema were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 40 Gy group than in the 50 Gy group . Long-term follow-up confirms that appropriately dosed hypofractionated radiotherapy is safe and effective for patients with early breast cancer . The results support the continued use of 40 Gy in 15 fractions , which has already been adopted by most UK centres as the standard of care for women requiring adjuvant radiotherapy for invasive early breast cancer .

DFS estimates at 4 years remained significantly more favorable ( 86.9 % vs. 84.5 % , respectively ) for patients receiving anastrozole compared with those receiving tamoxifen ( hazard ratio  HR  , 0.86 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.76-0 .99 ; P = 0.03 ) . The benefit generated by anastrozole in terms of DFS was even greater in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors ( HR , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.70-0 .96 ; P = 0.014 ) . The HR for TTR also indicated a significant benefit for patients receiving anastrozole compared with those receiving tamoxifen ( HR , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.71-0 .96 ; P = 0.015 ) , with additional benefit for patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors ( HR , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.65-0 .93 ; P = 0.007 ) . CLBC incidence data also continued to favor anastrozole ( odds ratio  OR  , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.38-1 .02 ; P = 0.062 ) , and statistical significance was achieved in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup ( OR , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.32-0 .98 ; P = 0.042 ) . The updated safety analysis also confirmed the findings of the first analysis , in that endometrial cancer ( P = 0.007 ) , vaginal bleeding and discharge ( P < 0.001 for both ) , cerebrovascular events ( P < 0.001 ) , venous thromboembolic events ( P < 0.001 ) , and hot flashes ( P < 0.001 ) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group , whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures ( P < 0.001 for both ) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group . These results indicated that the safety profile of anastrozole remained consistent . After an additional follow-up period , anastrozole continues to show superior efficacy , which is most apparent in the clinically relevant hormone receptor-positive population . Furthermore , anastrozole has numerous noteworthy advantages in terms of tolerability compared with tamoxifen . These findings suggest that the benefits of anastrozole are likely to be maintained in the long term and provide further support for the status of anastrozole as a valid treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early-stage breast cancer . \" \n",

Here , we present the HPV genotypes found in first 500 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 ( CIN3 ) or more severe disease ( CIN3 + ) diagnosed at the study baseline . Women aged 30 and older were screened for cervical cancer using Pap smears and tested for carcinogenic HPV using Hybrid Capture 2 ( HC2 ; Qiagen ) . We randomly selected women who tested HPV positive and were diagnosed with CIN3 + ( n = 448 ) or without CIN3 + ( < CIN3 ; n = 830 ) . Residual cervical Pap specimens were HPV genotyped using a MY09/11 L1-targeted PCR method . Among HC2-positive women , HPV16 ( 48.9 % ) , HPV31 ( 9.2 % ) , and HPV18 ( 8.5 % ) were the most common HPV genotypes in CIN3 + . There was a decrease at older ages in the fraction of CIN3 ( P ( trend ) = 0.006 ) , adenocarcinoma in situ ( AIS ) ( P ( trend ) = 0.08 ) , and CIN3/AIS ( P ( trend ) = 0.002 ) associated with HPV16 . Compared to the other carcinogenic HPV genotypes in aggregate , HPV18 was strongly associated with CIN3 + in women with a normal Pap  odds ratio ( OR ) = 5.7 , 95 % CI = 1.2-26  but not in women with abnormal Pap ( OR = 1.3 , 95 % CI = 0.74-2 .3 ) . HPV16 is more strongly associated with cervical precancer diagnosed in younger women ( vs. older women ) . HPV18 infections were linked to precancerous lesions that were missed by cytology . The progression timeline of HPV16 differs from other carcinogenic HPV genotypes , which may impact the use of HPV16 detection in the management of HPV-positive women . \" \n",

Recently , short-term infusions of 5-FU given over 30 or 60 min have been substituted for conventional `` bolus 5-FU given over 3-5 min in randomized clinical trials , but there are only limited pharmacokinetic data for these altered infusion durations ., We therefore wished to determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicity associated with 5-FU given as a 1-h intravenous ( i.v. ) infusion . A group of 22 adults with advanced gastrointestinal tract cancers and no prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease received interferon alpha-2a ( 5 MU/m2 s.c. , days 1-7 ) , leucovorin ( 500 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 min , days 2-6 ) and 5-FU ( 370 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 h , days 2-6 ) . The doses of 5-FU and interferon-alpha were adjusted according to individual tolerance . The pharmacokinetics and clinical toxicity were retrospectively compared with patients receiving the same regimen under the same treatment guidelines except that 5-FU was given over 5 min . The regimen was well tolerated , and 41 % of the patients tolerated 5-FU dose escalations to 425-560 mg/m2 per day . Grade 3 or worse diarrhea and fatigue ultimately occurred in 14 % of the patients each . Granulocytopenia , mucositis , and diarrhea appeared to be appreciably milder in the present trial compared with our prior phase II experience in colorectal cancer . The peak 5-FU plasma levels and AUC with 370 mg/m2 5-FU given over 1 h were 7.3-fold and 2.4-fold lower than previously measured in 31 patients who received 5-FU over 5 min . Increasing the length of 5-FU infusion to 1 h seemed to substantially reduce the clinical toxicity with this modulated 5-FU regimen , likely due to markedly lower peak 5-FU plasma levels and AUC . Changes in the duration of a short infusion of 5-FU clearly affects the clinical toxicity , but raises the concern of a potentially adverse impact on its antitumor activity . These results suggest the importance of including precise guidelines concerning the time over which 5-FU is given in clinical trials . Having a specified duration of 5-FU infusion is also important if 5-FU dose escalation is considered . \" \n",

However , achieving tumor control might reverse the catabolic processes causing cachexia . There is limited knowledge about muscle mass changes during chemotherapy or whether changes in muscle mass are associated with response to chemotherapy . In this pilot study , patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receiving three courses of palliative chemotherapy were analyzed . Muscle mass was measured as skeletal muscle cross sectional area ( SMCA ) at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae using CT images taken before and after chemotherapy . In total 35 patients , 48 % women , mean age 67 years ( range 56-86 ) , participated ; 83 % had stage IV disease and 71 % were sarcopenic at baseline . Mean reduction in SMCA from pre - to post-chemotherapy was 4.6 cm2 ( CI 95 % -7.3 -- 1.9 ; p < 0.002 ) , corresponding to a 1.4 kg loss of whole body muscle mass . Sixteen patients remained stable or gained SMCA . Of these , 14 ( 56 % ) responded to chemotherapy , while two progressed ( p = 0.071 ) . Maintaining or gaining SMCA resulted in longer median overall survival ( loss : 5.8 months , stable/gain : 10.7 months ; p = 0.073 ) . Stage of disease ( p = 0.003 ) , treatment regimen ( p = 0.023 ) , response to chemotherapy ( p = 0.007 ) and SMCA change ( p = 0.040 ) , but not sarcopenia at baseline , were significant prognostic factors in the multivariate survival analyses . Almost half of the patients had stable or increased muscle mass during chemotherapy without receiving any cachexia treatment . Nearly all of these patients responded to the chemotherapy . Increase in muscle mass , but not sarcopenia at baseline , was a significant prognostic factor . \" \n",

Patients in the intervention group will follow a stepped care model with 4 evidence based steps : 1 . Watchful waiting , 2 . Guided self-help via Internet or a booklet , 3 . Problem Solving Treatment administered by a specialized nurse , and 4 . Specialized psychological intervention or antidepressant medication . In the control group , patients receive care as usual which most often is a single interview or referral to specialized intervention . Primary outcome is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) . Secondary outcome measures are a clinical level of depression or anxiety ( CIDI ) , quality of life ( EQ-5D , EORTC QLQ-C30 , QLQ-HN35 , QLQ-LC13 ) , patient satisfaction with care ( EORTC QLQ-PATSAT ) , and costs ( health care utilization and work loss ( TIC-P and PRODISQ modules ) ) . Outcomes are evaluated before and after intervention and at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12months after intervention . Stepped care is a system of delivering and monitoring treatments , such that effective , yet least resource-intensive , treatment is delivered to patients first . The main aim of a stepped care approach is to simplify the patient pathway , provide access to more patients and to improve patient well-being and cost reduction by directing , where appropriate , patients to low cost ( self - ) management before high cost specialist services .

            " \"content\" : \" Hot flushes are the most common complaints reported by men undergoing androgen suppression treatment for prostate cancer . We designed a randomised double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of three drugs , each of which has proven effective for preventing hot flushes in previous studies . Men with prostate cancer with an indication for androgen suppression were enrolled in the study at 106 urology centres in France between April 14 , 2004 , and April 20 , 2007 . All patients were treated for 6 months with leuprorelin ( 11.25 mg ) . At month 6 , patients who spontaneously asked for treatment , or those who presented with 14 hot flushes or more during the week before the visit , were randomly assigned to either venlafaxine 75 mg daily , medroxyprogesterone acetate 20 mg daily , or cyproterone acetate 100 mg daily . All patients received two indistinguishable pills in the morning and one in the evening from week 1 to week 8 , and one indistinguishable pill in the morning from week 9 to week 10 , to comply with the double-blind design . Random assignment with a block size of three was done centrally , by fax , and each patient was given a randomisation number . The allocation sequence was stratified by centre . Assessment was done at inclusion , at randomisation , and then at 4 weeks , 8 weeks , and 12 weeks after randomisation . Participants completed a daily hot-flush diary for 1 week , and a quality of life questionnaire before each visit throughout the study . The primary outcome was the change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation and 1 month . All patients who received at least one study treatment dose were included in the efficacy analysis . This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01011751 . Of the 919 men initially enrolled , 311 were randomly assigned to one of the study treatments at 6 months : 102 to venlafaxine , 101 to cyproterone , and 108 to medroxyprogesterone . 309 patients were included in the efficacy analysis , since two were excluded for protocol deviations ( one in the cyproterone and one in the medroxyprogesterone group ; both were excluded because they were already undergoing treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants at randomisation ) . The change in median daily hot-flush score between randomisation and 1 month was -47.2 % ( IQR -74.3 to -2.5 ) in the venlafaxine group , -94.5 % ( -100.0 to -74.5 ) in the cyproterone group , and -83.7 % ( -98.9 to -64.3 ) in the medroxyprogesterone group . The decrease from baseline was significant for all three groups ( p < 0.0001 ) . Pairwise comparison of treatment groups adjusted by the Bonferroni method confirmed that the decreases in hot-flush score were significantly larger in the cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone groups than in the venlafaxine group , regardless of the interval considered ( p < 0.0001 in all cases ) . There was no significant difference between the cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone groups ( p > 0.2 in all cases ) . Serious side-effects occurred in four , seven , and five patients in the venlafaxine , cyproterone , and medroxyprogesterone groups , respectively , of which none , one ( dyspnoea ) , and one ( urticaria ) were considered related to the drug , respectively . After 6 months of treatment with leuprorelin , venlafaxine , cyproterone , and medroxyprogesterone proved to be effective in reducing hot flushes . However , the hormonal treatments cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone were significantly more effective than venlafaxine . As cyproterone is a recognised treatment in prostate cancer , and its use could interfere with hormonal therapy , medroxyprogesterone could be considered to be the standard treatment for hot flushes in men undergoing androgen suppression for prostate cancer .

Forty-five centers included 612 patients in this study : 206 on NVB-P , 200 on VDS-P , and 206 on NVB . Vinorelbine was administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 weekly , cisplatin at 120 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 and then every 6 weeks , and vindesine at 3 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks and then every other week . Treatment was continued until progression or toxicity . Four percent of the patients entered were ineligible and 59 % had metastatic disease . An objective response rate was observed in 30 % of patients in the NVB-P arm versus 19 % in the VDS-P arm ( P = .02 ) and 14 % in the NVB arm ( P < .001 ) . The median duration of survival was 40 weeks in the NVB-P arm , compared with 32 weeks in the VDS-P arm and 31 weeks in the NVB arm . Comparison of survival among the three groups demonstrated an advantage for NVB-P compared with VDS-P ( P = .04 ) and NVB ( P = .01 ) . Neutropenia was significantly higher in the NVB-P group ( P < .001 ) , and neurotoxicity was more frequent with VDS-P ( P < .004 ) . Since our results have demonstrated that NVB-P yields a longer survival duration and a higher response rate than VDS-P or NVB alone , with acceptable toxicity , this combination should be considered a relevant regimen in advanced NSCLC . \" \n",

Data of 9521 patients with invasive T1-2M0 breast carcinoma and initial treatment with SLNB completed or not by ALND and 3 or more MLN were extracted from the SEER database . Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed . Overall , 9521 patients were included in the study . SLNB-alone compared with ALND did not result in different overall survival ( OS ) or specific survival ( SS ) for patients with 3 or more MLN ( p = 0.46 and 0.58 , respectively ) . In subgroup analyses , OS was comparable between SLNB-alone and ALND when patients had only 3 or more than 3 MLN . When patients had 3 MLN , the 5-year SS was significantly better for patients with ALND compared with SLNB-alone : 91.5 % and 85.1 % , respectively ( p = 0.02 ) . The Hazard Ratio ( HR ) for OS comparing SLNB-alone with ALND adjusting for age , adjuvant radiotherapy , tumor size , estrogen receptor status , grade and tumor type resulted in an HR of 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 0.72-1 .54 , p = 0.77 ) . In conclusion , patients with a T1-T2 invasive breast cancer and at least 3 MLN do not benefit from ALND after SLNB for specific and overall survival , thus limiting ALND to a staging procedure . A subgroup of patients with 3 MLN had a better SS with ALND , possibly due to an under-staging of the SLNB-alone group . \" \n",

A multi-institutional randomized-controlled trial ( JCOG0404 ) was conducted to evaluate open and laparoscopic D3 resection ( complete mesocolic excision + ligation and dissection at the root of the main vessels ) for Stage II/III colon cancer ( UMIN-CTR number C000000105 ) . A total of 1057 ( open , 528 ; laparoscopic , 529 ) eligible patients were enrolled . For quality control , it was ensured that the surgeries were performed by accredited surgeons , and a central committee reviewed each surgery on the basis of the submitted photographs of the resected field , specimen and skin incision . For right-sided tumors , the rate of D3 resection was 98.5 % ( 131/133 ) in the open arm and 100 % ( 136/136 ) in the laparoscopic arm , and for left-sided tumors , they were 97.9 % ( 322/329 ) and 98.2 % ( 320/326 ) , respectively . Sufficient length of the resected longitudinal margin was ensured in all cases . The skin incisions made in all the cases were < 8 cm as defined in the protocol in laparoscopic arm . Completion of high quality surgery with D3 resection was confirmed in JCOG0404 by central peer review of photographs of the surgical procedures in addition to operator regulations . This study suggests that the central review of the photo documentation is one of the important tools to assure a quality control of surgical technique in the Phase III randomized-controlled study . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Hepatic resection is currently still the best choice of therapeutic strategies for liver cancer , but the long-term survival rate after surgery is unsatisfactory . Most patients develop intra - and/or extrahepatic recurrence . The reasons for this high recurrence rate are not entirely clear . Recent studies have indicated that ischemia-reperfusion injury to the liver may be a significant factor promoting tumor recurrence and metastasis in animal models . If this is also true in humans , the effects of the Pringle maneuver , which has been widely used in hepatectomy for the past century , should be examined . To date , there are no reported data or randomized controlled studies examining the relationship between use of the Pringle maneuver and local tumor recurrence . We hypothesize that the long-term prognosis of patients with liver cancer could be worsened by use of the Pringle maneuver due to an increase in the rate of tumor recurrence in the liver remnant . We designed a multicenter , prospective , randomized surgical trial to test this hypothesis . At least 498 eligible patients from five participating centers will be enrolled and randomized into either the Pringle group or the non-Pringle group in a ratio of 1:1 using a permuted-blocks randomization protocol . After the completion of surgical intervention , patients will be included in a 3-year follow-up program . This multicenter surgical trial will examine whether the Pringle maneuver has a negative effect on the long-term outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma patients . The trial will also provide information about prognostic differences , safety , advantages and disadvantages between Pringle and non-Pringle surgical procedures . Ultimately , the results will increase the available information about the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury on tumor recurrence , which will be of immense benefit to general surgery . http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00725335 . \" \n",

A total of 119 general practices with 266 GPs were randomised into two groups . Intervention GPs were offered direct access to chest LDCT combined with a Continuing Medical Education ( CME ) meeting on lung cancer diagnosis . During a 19-month period , 648 patients were referred to LDCT ( 0.18 / 1000 adults on GP list/month ) . Half of the patients needed further diagnostic work-up , and 15 ( 2.3 % , 95 % CI : 1.3-3 .8 % ) of the patients had lung cancer ; 60 % ( 95 % CI : 32.3-83 .7 % ) in a localised stage . The GP referral rate was 61 % higher for CME participants compared to non-participants . Of all patients referred to LDCT , 2.3 % were diagnosed with lung cancer with a favourable stage distribution . Half of the referred patients needed additional diagnostic work-up . There was an association between participation in CME and use of CT scan . The proportion of cancers diagnosed through the usual fast-track evaluation was 2.2 times higher in the group of CME-participating GPs . The question remains if primary care case-finding with LDCT is a better option for patients having signs and symptoms indicating lung cancer than a screening program . Whether open access to LDCT may provide earlier diagnosis of lung cancer is yet unknown and a randomised trial is required to assess any effect on outcome . Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01527214 . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" The effect of tamoxifen on cyclic mastalgia and on chemoprophylaxis against breast cancer is little known , mainly due to the difficulties in studying the normal human gland . We proposed to evaluate the mitotic index and the nuclear volume of the lobule of women medicated with tamoxifen only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in order to observe the effect of tamoxifen on the normal human mammary gland . Twenty-four premenopausal women with fibroadenoma diagnosed via biopsy were studied . The phase of the cycle was determined by the date of menstruation and serum progesterone level in the luteal phase ( > or = 3 ng/ml ) . The patients admitted to the study and were given written informed consent to participate in the investigation , which was previously approved of by the hospital Ethics Committee . Patients were divided at random into two groups : Group I consisted of 12 untreated women ( control ) and Group II consisted of 12 patients treated with 20 mg/day tamoxifen for 10 consecutive days beginning on the 13th day of the menstrual cycle . In both groups , the patients were submitted to biopsies of the nodule and of a 1-cm3 fragment of adjacent mammary parenchyma between the 23rd and 26th day of the cycle . The mitotic index ( number of mitoses/1000 nuclei counted ) and mean nuclear volume ( mean of 10 nuclear volumes for each case ) were measured . No mitosis was observed in Group II . There was a reduction in the mean nuclear volume in Group II ( Mann-Whitney test ) . Tamoxifen , when administered only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle , significantly reduces the nuclear volume and mitotic activity of the epithelium . This data demonstrates an antagonistic action of tamoxifen on estrogen even when administered for short periods of time . \" \n",

A prospective randomized study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of four courses of doxorubicin hydrochloride followed by eight courses of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and fluorouracil ( CMF ) ( sequential regimen ) vs two courses of CMF alternated with one course of doxorubicin for a total of 12 courses ( alternating regimen ) . All drug courses were recycled every 3 weeks . The median duration of follow-up at the time of current analysis was 9 years . The study was conducted on patients operated on for primary unilateral breast cancer at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan , Italy . Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology . A total of 405 women were entered into the study , 403 of whom met the protocol criteria . Patient characteristics were fairly well balanced between the two treatment groups , with the exception of extent of nodal involvement : 38 % with more than 10 positive nodes were randomized to the alternating regimen compared with 29 % in the sequential regimen ( P = .08 ) . Relapse-free and total survival at 10 years after surgery estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier product limit method . Treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients who received the sequential regimen compared with those given the alternating chemotherapy . The relapse-free survival was 42 % vs 28 % ( P = .002 ) and total survival was 58 % vs 44 % ( P = .002 ) , respectively . The benefit of the sequential regimen was evident in all patient subsets . Treatment was fairly well tolerated , but we documented four cases of congestive heart failure , which was fatal in two patients . Current findings indicate that in women with extensive nodal involvement , sequential chemotherapy with doxorubicin followed by CMF yields superior results compared with the alternating administration of the same regimens or with classical CMF . \" \n",

Survival probabilities at 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 years , as estimated from published survival curves , were considered as the endpoints of interest . For survival at 3 and 5 years , the point estimates and the confidence intervals were used . Quality scoring of the studies also was performed . Fourteen trials were selected , comprising 1887 patients in the meta-analysis . For the cisplatin-based group , the estimated pooled odds ratio of death at 1 and 2 years was 0.76 ( 0.6-0 .9 CI ) and 0.70 ( 0.5-0 .9 CI ) , with a reduction in mortality of 24 % and 30 % , respectively . For the noncisplatin-based group , the estimated pooled odds ratio at 1 and 2 years was 1.05 ( 0.7-1 .5 CI ) and 0.82 ( 0.5-1 .3 CI ) , with a reduction in mortality of 5 % and 18 % , respectively . However , no significant differences were found between the percentage of survival and the CI at 3 and 5 years using the point estimates . These results favor combined cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy , although it was not so at 3 and 5 years of survival . These data must , however , be considered in the light of their clinical relevance and of the balance between quality of life , toxicity , and costs of chemotherapy . \" \n",

Patients undergoing primary surgery for breast cancer and controls matched for age , menopausal and hysterectomy status were prospectively recruited . Serum VEGF , FSH , LH , estrogen , progesterone and platelet levels were measured . Serum VEGF was corrected for platelet load ( sVEGFp ) to provide a biologically relevant measurement of circulating VEGF . SVEGFp levels were analyzed with respect to tumor characteristics , menopausal status and hysterectomy status . Two hundred women were included in the study ; 89 breast cancer patients and 111 controls . SVEGFp levels were significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared to controls ( p = 0.0001 ) , but were not associated with clinico-pathological tumor characteristics . Systemic VEGF levels reduced significantly in the breast cancer patients following tumor excision ( p = 0.018 ) . The highest systemic VEGF levels were observed in postmenopausal breast cancer patients . Postmenopausal women who had had a previous hysterectomy had significantly higher VEGF levels than those with an intact postmenopausal uterus ( p = 0.001 ) .

Patients were given intravenous dexamethasone ( 20 mg ) or physiological saline with intravenous ondansetron 8 mg before cisplatin , then ondansetron 1 mg/h for 24 hours . Oral ondansetron 8 mg was taken three times daily on days 2-6 . Incidence of complete or major control of emesis ( 0-2 episodes in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ) . Complete or major control was obtained in 49 out of 71 ( 69 % ) of patients after receiving ondansetron plus dexamethasone compared with 40 out of 71 ( 56 % ) when they were given ondansetron alone ( p = 0.012 ) . This effect was most pronounced in the first 12 hours after chemotherapy . Patients receiving the combination also had significantly less nausea . Of the 53 patients who expressed a preference , 38 ( 72 % ) preferred the combination treatment ( p = 0.002 ) to ondansetron alone . The effect of ondansetron on delayed emesis was less pronounced . Dexamethasone makes a significant contribution to the efficacy of ondansetron in the control of acute platinum induced emesis . \" \n",

Patients who were scheduled to perform right hemicolectomy between August 2009 and December 2010 were randomized into either HALC or OC group . Patients were excluded if they had synchronous cancers , hepatic metastases , acute intestinal obstruction , or intestinal perforations . All the operations in the 2 groups were performed by a single surgical team . Measured outcomes included the demographic variables and perioperative parameters . The former included age , sex , body mass index , American Society of Anesthesiologists class , prior abdominal surgery , distribution of tumors , and histopathologic stage ; whereas the latter included length of incision , operative time , estimated blood loss , conversion rate , number of lymph nodes retrieved , postoperative pain score , time to return of bowel function , postoperative complications , duration of hospital stay , and total cost . One hundred sixteen patients with cancer of the right hemicolon ( HALC = 59 , OC = 57 ) were recruited . The 2 groups of patients were similar in age , sex distribution , body mass index , American Society of Anesthesiologists class , and previous abdominal surgery . No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of distribution of tumors and the final histopathologic staging . HALC had a significantly shorter incision length and longer operative time than OC . Patients in the HALC group had significantly less operative blood loss , less pain and earlier passage of flatus after operation than those in the OC group . The number of lymph nodes recovered in the specimen and the overall postoperative complications was comparable in the 2 groups . The postoperative duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the HALC group , whereas the median overall costs in the HALC group were significantly higher than that in the OC group . The results from the present study demonstrate that the HALC is a valid surgical approach for cancer of the right hemicolon that retains the benefits of minimally invasive surgery . We believe that this technique is a safe , useful , and feasible method for patients with right-sided colonic cancer . If practiced more , it might be advocated as a `` bridge between traditional laparoscopic surgery and conventional open procedures ., \" \n",

Treatment-related morbidity was monitored by mailed questionnaires , using a modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group rectal morbidity criteria at 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months . Patients who reported grade 1 or worse rectal morbidity were interviewed by telephone to clarify details regarding their rectal bleeding . Persistent rectal bleeding occurred in 36 of the 548 evaluable patients ( 7 % ) . The mean gap among rectal bleeders was 3.8 days and among nonbleeders was 4.8 days ( P = 0.236 ) . Higher R100 and external beam dose of 44 Gy were significant predictors of rectal bleeding on univariate and multivariate analysis . Log-rank analysis did not demonstrate any improvement in biochemical failure free survival ( BFFS ) with shorter gap interval . On univariate analysis , Gleason score > 7 , PSA > 10 , D90 < 100 % , and treatment gap were all predictive of biochemical failure . On multivariate analysis , only Gleason score , PSA , and D90 remained significant predictors of BFFS . Shorter gap intervals between supplemental beam radiation and brachytherapy implant are safe . Shorter gap intervals do not improve BFFS ; however , they do allow for treatment completion in a more timely fashion . \" \n",

Within 6 weeks of surgery ( radical mastectomy , modified radical mastectomy , or lumpectomy ) , 1550 patients with unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms : high - , moderate - , or low-dose intensity . The patients received cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and 5-fluorouracil on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle , with 5-fluorouracil administration repeated on day 8 . The high-dose arm had twice the dose intensity and twice the drug dose as the low-dose arm .

The adherence promotion strategy was guided by a theoretical model . The adherence intervention contains both a generalized portion given to all participants and an individualized portion given to marginal ( 50-74 % intake ) and low ( under 50 % intake ) adherers . A regression model was employed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions both at the first intervention and at subsequent times . The Health Behavior in Cancer Prevention Model-based adherence promotion intervention was associated with retention of participants , both during the run-in period and after randomization ( P = 0.05 ) ; and maximization of the percentage of the 13.5-g recommended fiber supplement consumed during the trial ( 92.5 % ) . The positive effects of the adherence intervention were greater with first-time nonadherers and the control group than with the experimental group . The high-fiber group had notably more biological GI effects from the increased fiber intake , more preexisting comorbidities , and lower perceived cognitive and physical health status . Randomized participants had excellent adherence overall . Retention rates in the trial were better than would be expected without the adherence intervention , especially among those participants who may have been at higher risk for dropping out of the study . This suggests that a systematic , theoretically based adherence strategy should be further tested in clinical trial settings in which lower adherence is a problem . \" \n",

To control this effect , study protocols have applied autologous blood donation programs , which are thought to be immunologically neutral . However , evidence has emerged that blood donation itself might have suppressive effects on natural killer ( NK ) cell activities . At present , there are no data available on the effects of autologous blood transfusion on NK or lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells . This might be of interest as LAK cells may be active in tumor control . 26 patients who underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer , were assigned at random into two groups : ( 1 ) autologous blood donation and transfusion , or ( 2 ) allogeneic blood transfusion . NK and LAK activities were determined before blood donation , at surgery , and on the 3rd and 8th postoperative day . Blood donation induced a small decrease in NK and LAK activities . The postoperative courses of the two groups differed . In the allogeneic group , NK activity ( -50 % , p = 0.018 ) and LAK activity decreased ( -60.7 % , p = 0.043 ) , whereas in the autologous group the decline in LAK was less pronounced ( -33.7 % , p = 0.091 ) , and their NK activity even increased ( +17.4 % , p = 0.315 ) . NK activity was modulated differently in the two study groups ( 0.0036 ) . Differences in LAK activities were found between the 3rd and 8th day postoperatively ( p = 0.354 ) .

This study aimed to investigate whether parallel gene expression profiling of the primary tumor can contribute to stratification of patients into groups of responders or nonresponders . Pretherapeutic biopsies from 30 locally advanced rectal carcinomas were analyzed for gene expression signatures using microarrays . All patients were participants of a phase III clinical trial ( CAO/ARO/AIO -94 , German Rectal Cancer Trial ) and were randomized to receive a preoperative combined-modality therapy including fluorouracil and radiation . Class comparison was used to identify a set of genes that were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders as measured by T level downsizing and histopathologic tumor regression grading . In an initial set of 23 patients , responders and nonresponders showed significantly different expression levels for 54 genes ( P < .001 ) . The ability to predict response to therapy using gene expression profiles was rigorously evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation . Tumor behavior was correctly predicted in 83 % of patients ( P = .02 ) . Sensitivity ( correct prediction of response ) was 78 % , and specificity ( correct prediction of nonresponse ) was 86 % , with a positive and negative predictive value of 78 % and 86 % , respectively . Our results suggest that pretherapeutic gene expression profiling may assist in response prediction of rectal adenocarcinomas to preoperative chemoradiotherapy .

The severity of mucositis may also depend on the time of administration of radiation apart from patient-related factors . The most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle ( G2-M ) occurs in the late afternoon and evening in human oral mucosa ; therefore , it is more vulnerable to radiation injury in the evening . The present study evaluated prospectively the severity of acute oral mucositis in head and neck carcinoma patients irradiated in the morning ( 08:00 -11:00 h ) versus late afternoon/evening ( 15:00 -18:00 h ) .

The grades of mucositis were marginally higher in the evening-irradiated group than in the morning-irradiated group 38 % vs. 26 % ( p = 0.08 ) . The observed incidence of grade III/IV mucositis in morning vs. evening irradiated patients may be because of the existence of circadian rhythm in the cell cycle of normal mucosa .

In addition , we asked patient s occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete gradual return-to-work plan ., Outcomes at 12 months of follow-up included rate and time until return-to-work ( full or partial ) , quality of life , work ability , work functioning , and lost productivity costs . Time until return-to-work was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis . Return-to-work rates were 86 % and 83 % ( p = 0.6 ) for the intervention group and control group when excluding 8 patients who died or with a life expectancy of months at follow-up . Median time from initial sick leave to partial return-to-work was 194 days ( range 14-435 ) versus 192 days ( range 82-465 ) ( p = 0.90 ) with a hazard ratio of 1.03 ( 95 % CI 0.64-1 .6 ) .

A randomized clinical trial ( JCOG9502 ) comparing transhiatal ( TH ) and left thoracoabdominal ( LTA ) approaches was stopped after the first interim analysis owing to limited efficacy for LTA resections . Complete 10-year follow-up data are now available . Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the OGJ or gastric cardia with oesophageal invasion of 3cm or less were randomized to a TH or LTA approach . Both groups underwent total gastrectomy and splenectomy with D2 nodal dissection plus para-aortic lymphadenectomy above the left renal vein . For LTA , a thorough mediastinal lymphadenectomy below the left inferior pulmonary vein was also mandatory . The primary endpoint was overall survival . A total of 167 patients ( 82 TH , 85 LTA ) were enrolled . The 10-year overall survival rate was 37 ( 95 per cent c.i. 26 to 47 ) per cent for the TH approach and 24 ( 15 to 34 ) per cent for the LTA technique ( P = 0060 ) . The hazard ratio for death was 142 ( 098 to 205 ) for the LTA technique . Subgroup analysis based on the Siewert classification indicated non-significant survival advantages in favour of the TH approach . LTA resections should be avoided in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the OGJ or gastric cardia . NCT00149266 ( https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . \" \n",

Forty-eight patients with unresectable recurrent rectal cancer were randomized and treated by 3-DCRT or 3-DCRT combined with FOLFOX4 chemotherapy between September 2001 and October 2003 . For the patients without prior radiation history , the initial radiation was given to the whole pelvis by traditional methods with tumor dose of 40 Gy , followed by 3-DCRT for the recurrent lesions to the median total cumulative tumor dose of 60 Gy ( range 56-66 Gy ) ; for the post-radiation recurrent patients , 3-DCRT was directly given for the recurrent lesions to the median tumor dose of 40 Gy ( 36-46 Gy ) . For patients in the study group , two cycles chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 regimen were given concurrently with radiotherapy , with the first cycle given simultaneously with the initiation of radiation and the second cycle given in the fifth week for patients receiving conventional pelvis radiation or given in the last week of 3-DCRT for patients receiving 3-DCRT directly . Another 2-4 cycles ( average 3.6 cycles ) sequential FOLFOX4 regimen chemotherapy were given to the patients in the study group , beginning at 2-3 wk after chemoradiation . The outcomes of symptoms relieve , tumor response , survival and toxicity were recorded and compared between the study group and the control group . For the study group and the control group , the pain-alleviation rates were 95.2 % and 91.3 % ( P > 0.05 ) ; the overall response rates were 56.5 % and 40.0 % ( P > 0.05 ) ; the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 86.9 % , 50.2 % and 80.0 % , 23.9 % , with median survival time of 25 mo and 16 mo ( P < 0.05 ) ; the 2-year distant metastasis rates were 39.1 % and 56.0 % ( P = 0.054 ) , respectively . The side effects , except peripheral neuropathy which was relatively severer in the study group , were similar in the the two groups and well tolerated . Three-dimensional conformal radio-therapy combined with FOLFOX4 chemotherapy for unresectable recurrent rectal cancer is a feasible and effective therapeutic approach , and can reduce distant metastasis rate and improve the survival rate . \" \n",

To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer . A population-based , prospective , randomized , controlled screening trial for prostate cancer started in 1995 ( the Gteborg branch of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer  ERSPC  ) . Ten thousand , randomly selected men aged 50-66 yr were invited for biennial PSA testing , with 10,000 men serving as passive controls for whom diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer was monitored by using the Swedish Cancer Registry . After a follow-up of 10 yr , the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer was reduced by 48.9 % - that is , decreasing from 47 cases in the control group to 24 cases in the group randomized to PSA-based screening ( p = 0.0084 ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer . \" \n",

Fifty patients with low-risk organ-confined PCa were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number to receive TVSSLRP and nsELRP , respectively . Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in such demographic and baseline data as age , comorbidity , body mass index ( BMI ) , serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , prostate volume , bioptic Gleason score , clinical stage , IIEF-5 score , nocturnal penile tumescence ( NPT ) , penile brachial index ( PBI ) , and penile arterial blood flow velocity as well as in such surgery-related parameters as operation duration , blood loss , blood transfusion , intraoperative complications , positive surgical margin , catheterization time , hospital stay , and postoperative Gleason score , pathologic stage , urinal pad use , PSA level , IIEF-5 score , NPT , PBI and PABFV . All the operations were successfully performed . There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups either in the demographic and baseline data or in intraoperative blood loss , blood transfusion rate , complications , and positive surgical margin . No intraoperative complications and positive surgical margins were found in either group . Compared with nsELRP , TVSSLRP achieved a significantly shorter operation duration (  151.46 40.68  min vs  105.92 26.21  min , P < 0.05 ) , catheterization time (  13.01 1.64  d vs  11.24 1.17  d , P < 0.05 ) , and hospital stay (  15.76 4.65  d vs  12.92 4.29  d , P < 0.05 ) . On the first day and at 1 , 3 and 6 months after catheter removal , the urinary continence rates in the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups were 84 % vs 52 % ( P < 0.05 ) , 100 % vs 84 % , 100 % vs 96 % , and 100 % vs 96 % , respectively ; and at 3 , 6 and 12 months after surgery , the erectile potency rates were 48 % vs 28 % ( P < 0.05 ) , 64 % vs 52 % , and 76 % vs 68 % , respectively , with an IIEF-5 score 18 , all evidently higher in the TVSSLRP than in the nsELRP group . The penile brachial index and arterial blood flow velocity of the two groups of patients exhibited no significant differences before and after surgery , nor did postoperative complications ( grade II ) between the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups ( 32 % vs 40 % , P > 0.05 ) . The Gleason score and pathologic stage were increased after surgery , but with remarkable differences between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . No biochemical recurrence was found in either group during a 12-month follow-up . With the advantages of safety and rapid postoperative recovery , both TVSSLRP and nsELRP are feasible for the treatment of low-risk organ-confined PCa , but the former may achieve an earlier recovery of urinary continence and erectile function than the latter . \" \n",

The trade-offs are between an improved life-expectancy with treatment accompanied by important risks such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction . Previous studies of preference elicitation for prostate cancer treatment have found considerable heterogeneity in individuals preferences for health states given similar treatments and clinical risks ., Using latent class mixture model ( LCA ) , we first sought to understand if there are unique patterns of heterogeneity or subgroups of individuals based on their prostate cancer treatment utilities ( calculated time trade-off utilities for various health states ) and if such unique subgroups exist , what demographic and urological variables may predict membership in these subgroups . The sample ( N = 244 ) included men with prostate cancer ( n = 188 ) and men at-risk for disease ( n = 56 ) . The sample was predominantly white ( 77 % ) , with mean age of 60 years ( SD + / -9.5 ) . Most ( 85.9 % ) were married or living with a significant other . Using LCA , a three class solution yielded the best model evidenced by the smallest Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ) , substantial reduction in BIC from a 2-class solution , and Lo-Mendell-Rubin significance of < .001 . The three identified clusters were named high-traders ( n = 31 ) , low-traders ( n = 116 ) , and no-traders ( n = 97 ) . High-traders were more likely to trade survival time associated with treatment to avoid potential risks of treatment . Low-traders were less likely to trade survival time and accepted risks of treatment . The no-traders were likely to make no trade-offs in any direction favouring the status quo . There was significant difference among the clusters in the importance of sexual activity ( Pearson s chi2 = 16.55 , P = 0.002 ; Goodman and Kruskal tau = 0.039 , P < 0.001 ) ., In multinomial logistic regression , the level of importance assigned to sexual activity remained an independent predictor of class membership . Age and prostate cancer/at-risk status were not significant factors in the multinomial model . Most existing utility work is undertaken focusing on how people choose on average . Distinct clusters of prostate cancer treatment utilities in our sample point to the need for further understanding of subgroups and need for tailored assessment and interventions . \" \n",

The study also aims to determine the merit and reliability of EIPL-IPC therapy as a prophylactic strategy for peritoneal metastasis . Although the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer patients with CY + / P - is extremely poor , a suitable standard regimen for treating such patients has not yet been established . A total of 88 patients with CY + / P - from 1522 patients with advanced gastric cancer at multicenters were enrolled in this study and were randomly allocated to 3 groups : surgery alone group , surgery plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( IPC ) group , and surgery plus EIPL and IPC ( EIPL-IPC ) group . Prognostic significance of EIPL-IPC therapy was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves , and its value as an independent prognostic factor was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses . The overall 5-year survival rate of the patients with EIPL-IPC was 43.8 % , and this data were significantly better than that of the IPC group ( 4.6 % , P < 0.0001 ) and the surgery alone group ( 0 % , P < 0.0001 ) . Among various recurrent patterns , the EIPL-IPC group had a significantly lower incidence of peritoneal recurrence than both of the other groups ( P < 0.0001 ) . Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that EIPL was the most significant impact factor . The present study clearly revealed that EIPL-IPC therapy significantly improved the 5-year survival span of advanced gastric cancer patients with CY + / P - . Thus , EIPL-IPC therapy is strongly recommended as a standard prophylactic strategy for peritoneal dissemination . \" \n",

Estimates of the TAM effect were expressed as hazard ratio ( HR ) of death of TAM over no-TAM patients with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) . At a median follow-up of 15 years , PrlRs , MVC , S-phase fraction , ploidy , and EGFR did not influence TAM efficacy . Differently , HER2 had an overall significant predictive effect : HR = 0.59 ( 95 % CI : 0.40-0 .87 ) in HER2-negative subjects versus HR = 1.09 ( 95 % CI : 0.63-1 .87 ) in HER2-positive subjects ( interaction test : P = 0.04 ) . The predictive effect of HER2 was also evident in the subgroup of patients with steroid receptor-positive tumors ( HER2 positive : HR = 1.33 , 95 % CI : 0.70-2 .51 ; HER2 negative : HR = 0.73 , 95 % CI : 0.47-1 .14 ) . With the statistical power of the present randomized trial , S-phase , ploidy , EGFR , PrlR , and MVC do not seem to predict for TAM efficacy . Conversely , our data support the hypothesis that tumors overexpressing HER2 might not benefit from adjuvant TAM . \" \n",

However , benefit of colorectal polypectomy in routine practice is still uncertain . We therefore investigated subsite-specific risks of colorectal cancer in relation to history of colorectal polypectomy in a case-control study . Both case patients and control subjects were residents aged 20-74 years in Fukuoka City and three adjacent areas . The case group comprised 840 patients undergoing surgery for a first diagnosis of colorectal cancer , while the control subjects were 833 residents who were selected in the community by two-stage random sampling . Past history of selected diseases , surgery and lifestyle factors were ascertained by in-person interview . Statistical adjustment was made for sex , 5-year age class , residence , smoking , alcohol drinking , physical activity , body mass index and parental history of colorectal cancer . Overall , 74 case patients ( 9 % ) and 85 control subjects ( 10 % ) reported a prior history of colorectal polyps , and 50 cases ( 6 % ) and 64 controls ( 8 % ) had a history of colorectal polypectomy . The adjusted odds ratio associated with colorectal polypectomy was 0.71 ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  0.48-1 .06 ) for the overall risk of colorectal cancer . The corresponding values for cancer of the proximal colon , distal colon , and rectum were 1.68 ( 95 % CI 0.98-2 .88 ) , 0.71 ( 95 % CI 0.41-1 .26 ) and 0.24 ( 95 % CI 0.11-0 .52 ) , respectively .

In the case of a life-threatening illness such as cancer , the weights placed on quality of life ( QOL ) and length of life ( LOL ) represent critical values . The objective of the current study was to describe cancer patient values regarding QOL and LOL and explore associations with communication preferences . Patients with advanced cancer completed a computer-based survey before the initial consultation with a medical oncologist . Assessments included sociodemographics , physical and mental health state , values regarding quality and length of life , communication preferences , and cancer-related distress . Among 459 patients with advanced cancer , 55 % placed equal valued on QOL and LOL , 27 % preferred QOL , and 18 % preferred LOL . Patients with a QOL preference had lower levels of cancer-related distress ( P < .001 ) . A QOL preference was also associated with older age ( P = .001 ) , male sex ( P = .003 ) , and higher educational level ( P = .062 ) . Patients who preferred LOL over QOL desired a more supportive and less pessimistic communication style from their oncologists . These data indicate that a values preference for LOL versus QOL may be simply measured , and is associated with wishes regarding the nature of oncologist communication . Awareness of these values during the clinical encounter could improve decision making by influencing the style and content of the communication between oncologists and their patients . \" \n",

The authors and others have shown that fibrin monomer allows preoperative risk stratification for intraoperative blood loss , likely due to an imbalance between available factor XIII and prothrombin conversion . The authors hypothesized that the use of factor XIII would delay the decrease of clot firmness in high-risk patients . The concept was tested in a prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in elective gastrointestinal cancer surgery . Patients were randomized to receive factor XIII ( 30 U/kg ) or placebo in addition to controlled standard therapy . Twenty-two patients were evaluable for a planned interim analysis . For the primary outcome parameter maximum clot firmness , patients receiving factor XIII showed a nonsignificant 8 % decrease , and patients receiving placebo lost 38 % , a highly significantly difference between the two groups ( P = 0.004 ) . A reduction in the nonprimary outcome parameters fibrinogen consumption ( -28 % , P = 0.01 ) and blood loss ( -29 % , P = 0.041 ) was also observed in the factor XIII group . Three patients experienced adverse events that seemed unrelated to factor XIII substitution . The trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis with the primary endpoint reached . This proof of concept study confirms the hypothesis that patients at high risk for intraoperative blood loss show reduced loss of clot firmness when factor XIII is administered early during surgery . Further clinical trials are needed to assess relevant clinical endpoints such as blood loss , loss of other coagulation factors , and use of blood products . \" \n",

The prostate biopsies were reviewed for Gleason score by one of us ( L.T. ) . A single manufacturer of ( 125 ) I sources ( Model 6711 , Amersham , Chicago , IL ) and ( 103 ) Pd sources ( Theraseed , Theragenics , Buford , Georgia ) was used . Isotope implantation was performed with standard techniques , using a modified peripheral loading pattern . Of a total of 126 patients randomized , 11 were excluded , leaving 115 randomized patients for this analysis . Twenty patients received a short course of preimplant hormonal therapy , none of whom continued hormonal therapy after their implant procedure . Postimplant CT was obtained 2-4 hours after implantation . The dosimetric parameters analyzed included the percentage of the postimplant prostate or rectal volume covered by the prescription dose ( V ( 100 ) ) and the dose that covered 90 % of the postimplant prostate volume ( D ( 90 ) ) . Freedom from biochemical failure was defined as a serum PSA level < or = 0.5 ng/mL at last follow-up . Patients were censored at last follow-up if their serum PSA level was still decreasing . Patients whose serum PSA had reached a nadir at a value > 0.5 ng/mL were scored as having failure at the time at which their PSA had reached a nadir . The follow-up period for patients without failure ranged from 2.0 to 4.9 years ( median 2.9 ) . Freedom-from-failure curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method . Differences between groups were determined by the log-rank method . The actuarial biochemical freedom-from-failure rate at 3 years was 89 % for ( 125 ) I patients vs. 91 % for ( 103 ) Pd patients ( p = 0.76 ) . The 3-year biochemical freedom-from-failure rate for patients with a D ( 90 ) < 100 % of the prescription dose was 82 % vs. 97 % for patients with a D ( 90 ) > or = 100 % of the prescription dose ( p = 0.01 ) . Similarly , the 3-year biochemical freedom-from-failure rate for patients with a V ( 100 ) < 90 % of the prescription dose was 87 % vs. 97 % for patients with a V ( 100 ) > or = 90 % of the prescription dose ( p = 0.01 ) . The effect of the dosimetric parameters on biochemical control was most pronounced for ( 125 ) I , but also apparent for ( 103 ) Pd . The 3-year actuarial biochemical control rates for low early-stage prostate cancer are similar after ( 125 ) I and ( 103 ) Pd . \" \n",

Men aged 55-75 years were invited using the Rotterdam population registry ( 100 per cent coverage ) , of whom 42 per cent gave written informed consent . These men were randomized to receive either determination of prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , digital rectal examination ( DRE ) , transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) and biopsy on indication ( screening group ) , or no screening ( control group ) . To 626 consecutive men of the screening group a questionnaire was sent before the screening . To 500 randomly selected refusers ( no written informed consent ) a similar questionnaire was sent , followed by two reminders . In both refusers and attenders we addressed motives , knowledge of prostate cancer , attitudes towards screening , background characteristics and urological complaints ( American Urological Association symptom index , AUA7 ) . Response rates for questionnaires were 48 per cent in refusers and 99 per cent in attenders . Main reported motives for refusing were absence of urological complaints ( 57 per cent ) and anticipated pain or discomfort ( 18 per cent ) . Main reported motives for attending were personal benefit ( 82 per cent ) , contribution to science ( 49 per cent ) and presence of urological complaints ( 25 per cent ) . Compared with attenders , refusers were slightly and significantly older , less often married and had a lower level of education ; they had less knowledge about prostate cancer and a less positive attitude towards screening ; they had worse general health but fewer urological complaints ( AUA7 median 2 versus 4 , p < 0.001 ) . In refusing or attending population-based prostate cancer screening , urological complaints but also knowledge , attitudes and sociodemographic factors seem to play a role .

Cancer-related distress may be ameliorated by comprehensive preparation for treatment and addressing women s informational , physical , psychological and psychosexual needs ., This paper describes the protocol for a multisite randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) testing a novel intervention package which combines tailored specialist nursing consultations and telephone peer support with the primary aim to reduce psychological distress . Secondary aims assess patient quality of life , symptom distress , unmet supportive care needs , preparation for treatment , psychosexual functioning and vaginal stenosis . This multifaceted intervention comprises four nurse-led consultations coupled with four phone calls from a peer support volunteer ( GC survivor ) . The evidence-based intervention will be delivered at critical points in the illness trajectory : pre-treatment , mid-treatment , treatment completion and post-treatment . Nurses and peers undergo 2-day intensive training workshops , are guided by comprehensive study intervention manuals and receive ongoing supervision and support . Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of GC , be scheduled to receive curative radiotherapy , be aged 18 years or over and speak English . Three-hundred and six participants will be randomized to receive usual care or usual care with the intervention package . Study outcome measures will be collected at baseline , day 1 of radiotherapy and 1 , 6 and 12 months post radiotherapy . Clinical assessments of vaginal toxicity will occur at baseline , and 3 , 6 , and 12 months post radiotherapy . This timely research has the potential to substantially reduce the physical , psychosexual and supportive care needs of women with GC . Using a telephone peer support model , the intervention package ensures equitable access to support services for geographically isolated patients . The novel intervention engages peer volunteers who liaise with nurses to encourage adherence to professionally-delivered information and provide emotional support . It has been designed to be potentially transferable to a range of treatment settings and diseases . Based on pilot data , the proposed intervention was found to be useful and acceptable to patients and clinicians .

Cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzyme metabolizes tamoxifen to clinically active metabolites , and CYP2D6 polymorphisms may adversely affect tamoxifen efficacy . In this study , we investigated the clinical relevance of CYP2D6 polymorphisms . We obtained tumor tissues and isolated DNA from 4861 of 8010 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who enrolled in the randomized , phase III double-blind Breast International Group ( BIG ) 1-98 trial between March 1998 and May 2003 and received tamoxifen and/or letrozole treatment . Extracted DNA was used for genotyping nine CYP2D6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-based methods . Genotype combinations were used to categorize CYP2D6 metabolism phenotypes as poor , intermediate , and extensive metabolizers ( PM , IM , and EM , respectively ; n = 4393 patients ) . Associations of CYP2D6 metabolism phenotypes with breast cancer-free interval ( referred to as recurrence ) and treatment-induced hot flushes according to randomized endocrine treatment and previous chemotherapy were assessed . Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . All statistical tests were two-sided . No association between CYP2D6 metabolism phenotypes and breast cancer-free interval was observed among patients who received tamoxifen monotherapy without previous chemotherapy ( P = .35 ) . PM or IM phenotype had a non-statistically significantly reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence compared with EM phenotype ( PM or IM vs EM , HR of recurrence = 0.86 , 95 % CI = 0.60 to 1.24 ) . CYP2D6 metabolism phenotype was associated with tamoxifen-induced hot flushes ( P = .020 ) . Both PM and IM phenotypes had an increased risk of tamoxifen-induced hot flushes compared with EM phenotype ( PM vs EM , HR of hot flushes = 1.24 , 95 % CI = 0.96 to 1.59 ; IM vs EM , HR of hot flushes = 1.23 , 95 % CI = 1.05 to 1.43 ) . CYP2D6 phenotypes of reduced enzyme activity were not associated with worse disease control but were associated with increased hot flushes , contrary to the hypothesis . The results of this study do not support using the presence or absence of hot flushes or the pharmacogenetic testing of CYP2D6 to determine whether to treat postmenopausal breast cancer patients with tamoxifen . \" \n",

We conducted a prospective randomized trail to compare functional results : sensory deficit and/or shoulder pain in preserved ( group I ) vs sacrificed ( group II ) intercostal-brachial nerve ( IBN ) . From July 1993 to April 1994 , 128 patients presenting with an invasive operable breast cancer were operated on by mastectomy n = 28 or lumpectomy n = 100 and axillary dissection . The patients were eligible for randomization when the IBN was preserved at the end of the axillary dissection . Group I ( nerve preservation ) included 66 patients and group II ( nerve section ) 62 patients . The two groups were well balanced for TNM , type of surgery , number of nodes dissected and positive , post-operative adjuvant treatment . Examinations were conducted at 3 , 6 and 12 months after surgery . Sensory deficit in the IBN area was reported by one patient in group I and four patients in group II , at 3 months ( P = 0.36 , NS ) . No patients , apart from one in group II , reported functional trouble at 18 months . Major shoulder motion , limitation and pain developed in four patients in group I and three in group II ( NS ) . This was attributed to depression and treated adequately . Analysis of sensory deficit was impossible in these patients . Conservation of the IBN , while anatomically preferable , is not functionally necessary during axillary dissection for breast cancer . \" \n",

Forty-eight cases with lung cancer were randomly divided into two groups : TCM-WM group ( group I ) and the chemotherapy group ( group II ) ; and 20 healthy subjects were simultaneously compared . The relevant immune indices , clinical symptoms and signs , changes of solid tumor and living quality were dynamically observed . ( 1 ) The serum IL-2 level of lung cancer patients were significantly lower , while sIL-2R level higher than that of the healthy subjects . And they were raised and lowered respectively after treatment , especially in the group I , but different from the control group yet . And there were highly negative correlation between IL-2 and sIL-2R levels . ( 2 ) The percentage of CD3 , CD4 and the ratio CD4/CD8 were decreased markedly in both groups , except CD8 which was increased markedly . And the percentage of RBC-C3b RR was obviously lower , while that of RBC-ICR was obviously higher . But the above-mentioned indices could be improved after treatment , especially in the group I , and there were highly positive correlation between CD4/CD8 ratio and RBC-C3bRR . ( 3 ) After treatment , all above-mentioned indices were changed significantly to their corresponding opposites . However , in regard to the degree of improvement , the patients of group I were in a better position than those of group II . At the same time , improvement of their clinical symptoms and signs , change of solid tumor and living quality also showed advantageous . The therapeutic superiority of TCM-WM on lung cancer may be related with the modulation on immune function . Thus we can say that the effect of TCM-WM is better than that of chemotherapy alone . \" \n",

We determined the normal distribution of values and established the appropriate reference ranges for these 3 molecular forms of PSA and their ratios ( free-to-total , complexed-to-total and free-to-complexed PSA ) . Knowing the amount and ratio of these molecular forms appears to be useful in enhancing the ability of PSA to distinguish potentially curable prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia and in decreasing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies . A total of 422 healthy men 40 to 79 years old was randomly chosen from the male population of Olmsted County , Minnesota and underwent a detailed clinical examination that included digital rectal examination , serum PSA determination and transrectal ultrasound to exclude the presence of prostate cancer . Using newly developed , monoclonal-monoclonal immunofluorometric assays for each molecular form , the free , complexed and total PSA , and the ratios of these 3 forms were determined for each study participant . All 3 molecular forms correlated directly with patient age ( r = 0.45 , r = 0.43 and r = 0.45 , respectively ) . Using the 95th percentile , the recommended age-specific reference ranges for the free , complexed and total PSA forms , respectively , are 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 ng . / ml . for men 40 to 49 years old ; 0.7 , 1.5 and 3.0 ng . / ml . for men 50 to 59 years old ; 1.0 , 2.0 and 4.0 ng . / ml . for men 60 to 69 years old , and 1.2 , 3.0 and 5.5 ng . / ml . for men 70 to 79 years old . With regard to each of the ratios ( free-to-total , complexed-to-total and free-to-complexed PSA ) none correlated with patient age . As a result , the appropriate upper limit of normal ( 95th percentile ) for all 3 ratios is constant for men of all ages . These reference ranges are greater than 0.15 for free-to-total PSA ratio , less than 0.70 for complexed-to-total PSA ratio and greater than 0.25 for free-to-complexed PSA ratio . The free-to-total PSA ratio will have its greatest value for men with a serum PSA value between 2 and 10 ng . / ml . The establishment of appropriate reference ranges for free , complexed and total PSA as well as the ratios will allow the practicing urologist to incorporate these new parameters into the diagnostic evaluation of men at risk for early , potentially curable prostate cancer . \" \n",

We tested if traditional uptake of innovation concepts applied to surgeons in the experimental arm of the trial . The QIRC strategy included workshops , access to opinion leaders , intraoperative demonstrations , postoperative questionnaires , and audit and feedback . For intraoperative demonstrations , a participating surgeon invited an outside surgeon to demonstrate optimal rectal surgery techniques . We used surgeon timing in a demonstration to differentiate early and late adopters of the QIRC strategy . Surgeons completed surveys on perceptions of the strategy and personal characteristics . Nineteen of 56 surgeons ( 34 % ) requested an operative demonstration on their first case of rectal surgery . Early and late adopters had similar perceptions of the QIRC strategy and similar characteristics . Late adopters were less likely than early adopters to perceive an advantage for the surgical techniques promoted by the trial ( p = 0.023 ) . Most traditional diffusion of innovation concepts did not apply to surgeons in the QIRC trial , with the exception of the importance of perceptions of comparative advantage . \" \n",

Participants ( n = 53 ) consumed a controlled diet plus each of three treatments ( 15 or 30 g alcohol/day or a no-alcohol placebo beverage ) , during three 8-week periods in random order . We measured the antioxidants , vitamin E ( alpha ( alpha ) - and gamma ( gamma ) - tocopherols ) , selenium , and vitamin C in fasting blood samples which were collected at the end of diet periods , treated and frozen for assay at the end of the study . We also measured 15-F ( 2t ) - IsoP isoprostane , produced by lipid peroxidation , which serves as an indicator of oxidative stress and may serve as a biomarker for conditions favorable to carcinogenesis . After adjusting for BMI ( all models ) and total serum cholesterol ( tocopherol and isoprostane models ) we observed a significant 4.6 % decrease ( P = 0.02 ) in alpha-tocopherol and a marginally significant 4.9 % increase ( P = 0.07 ) in isoprostane levels when women consumed 30 g alcohol/day ( P = 0.06 and 0.05 for overall effect of alcohol on alpha-tocopherol and isoprostanes , respectively ) .

Fentanyl in OTF is absorbed across the oral mucosa , but a considerable portion is swallowed and absorbed enterally . Fentanyl metabolism is catalyzed by cytochrome P4503A4 ( CYP3A ) . The role of intestinal or hepatic first-pass metabolism and CYP3A activity in OTF disposition is unknown . This investigation examined the influence of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A activity on the disposition and clinical effects of OTF . Healthy volunteers ( n = 12 ) were studied in an Institutional Review Board-approved , randomized , balanced , four-way crossover . They received OTF ( 10 microg/kg ) after hepatic/intestinal CYP3A induction by rifampin , hepatic/intestinal CYP3A inhibition by troleandomycin , selective intestinal CYP3A inhibition by grapefruit juice , or nothing ( control ) . Plasma fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry . Fentanyl effects were measured by dark-adapted pupil diameter and subjective self-assessments using visual analog scales . : Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations , time to peak , and maximum pupil diameter change from baseline were unchanged after rifampin , troleandomycin , and grapefruit juice . Fentanyl elimination , however , was significantly affected by CYP3A alterations . After control , rifampin , troleandomycin and grapefruit juice , respectively , area under the curve of plasma fentanyl versus time was 5.9 + / - 3.7 , 2.2 + / - 0.8 , * 10.4 + / - 8.9 , * and 5.8 + / - 3.3 h x ng/ml ; norfentanyl/fentanyl plasma area under the curve ratios were 0.92 + / - 0.63 , 3.2 + / - 1.8 , * 0.08 + / - 0.14 , * and 0.67 + / - 0.33 ( * P < 0.05 versus control ) . Peak fentanyl concentrations and clinical effects after OTF were minimally affected by altering both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity , whereas fentanyl metabolism , elimination , and duration of effects were significantly affected ; selective intestinal CYP3A inhibition had minimal effects . This suggests that first-pass metabolism minimally influences OTF bioavailability . When treating breakthrough pain , with careful attention to maximal mucosal absorption and minimal swallowing , CYP3A variability and drug interactions are unlikely to affect the onset or magnitude of OTF analgesia ; however , duration may be affected . \" \n",

Response to treatment between the two measurement techniques was compared statistically using the chi2 test . Response to treatment was concordant in 76 patients between unidimensional and bidimensional measurement techniques . In 5 patients ( 2 lung and 3 liver metastases ) the response assessment was improved using unidimensional criteria and in 5 patients ( 2 lung and 3 liver metastases ) the response was worse using unidimensional guidelines . Thus , the overall response rate was 50 % for both unidimensional and bidimensional measurement techniques . There was no statistical difference between the two techniques . Unidimensional measurements are appropriate for measuring the size of liver and lung metastases for determining response to treatment during clinical testing of oncologic drugs . \" \n",

This study was aimed at comparing the existing strategies of postsigmoidoscopy referral to colonoscopy in terms of accuracy and resources needed . Asymptomatic individuals aged 50-69 years were eligible for a randomized controlled trial designed to compare colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test . Sigmoidoscopy yield was estimated from results obtained in the colonoscopy arm according to three sets of criteria of colonoscopy referral ( from those proposed in the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy , Screening for COlon REctum  SCORE  , and Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention  NORCCAP  trials ) . Advanced neoplasm detection rate , sensitivity , specificity , and number of individuals needed to refer for colonoscopy to detect one APN were calculated . Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify distal findings associated with APN . All statistical tests were two-sided . APN was found in 255 of 5059 ( 5.0 % ) individuals . Fulfillment of UK ( 6.2 % ) , SCORE ( 12.0 % ) , and NORCCAP ( 17.9 % ) criteria varied statistically significantly ( P < .001 ) . The NORCCAP strategy obtained the highest sensitivity for APN detection ( 36.9 % ) , and the UK approach reached the highest specificity ( 94.6 % ) . The number of individuals needed to refer for colonoscopy to detect one APN was 6 ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  = 4 to 7 ) , 8 ( 95 % CI = 6 to 9 ) , and 10 ( 95 % CI = 8 to 12 ) when the UK , SCORE , and NORCCAP criteria were used , respectively . The logistic regression analysis identified distal adenoma 10 mm ( odds ratio = 3.77 ; 95 % CI = 2.52 to 5.65 ) as the strongest independent predictor of APN . Whereas the NORCCAP criteria achieved the highest sensitivity for APN detection , the UK recommendations benefited from the lowest number of individuals needed to refer for colonoscopy . \" \n",

Forty consecutive breast cancer patients suffering troublesome hot flushes have been treated for 8 weeks with venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/day in an open-label study . Vasomotor symptoms have been evaluated before starting treatment and every 4 weeks with a hot flushes diary pointing out the number and the severity of vasomotor symptoms . A Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) was completed at baseline and at the end of the treatment . Thirty patients had completed the first 4 weeks of treatment , reporting a reduction of hot flushes frequency of 39 % as compared to baseline ( p < 0.001 ) . After 8 weeks of treatment , a further significant reduction was observed both for the hot flushes frequency ( -53 % ; p < 0.001 ) and for the hot flushes score ( -59 % ; p < 0.001 ) , a measure which reflects both the number and the severity of hot flushes . Very few side effects were reported , mostly nausea in the first 2 weeks of assumption and mouth dryness . Only 23 women had completed BDI at week 8 ; a reduction of 23 % was observed ( p = 0.000 ) . Venlafaxine is an effective treatment for the relief of vasomotor symptoms in patients previously treated for breast cancer . A favourable effect is maintained also in those patients using tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy . The use of the low dose ( 37.5 mg/day ) is associated with minimal side effects and produces a good improvement in hot flushes if pursued over 8 weeks . \" \n",

Randomized clinical studies of maintenance chemotherapy after complete response have failed to demonstrate survival advantage . However , studies have shown that the human cytokine interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) induces immune response in humans , including T-cell activation and expression of class II major histocompatibility complex ( HLA-DR ) and receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin on monocytes . It has also been demonstrated that recombinant IFN-gamma ( rIFN-gamma ) induces immunomodulation and has antiproliferative activity . In vivo effects of rIFN-gamma treatment were characterized by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with SCLC who received rIFN-gamma as maintenance treatment . After induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy , 100 patients who achieved a complete remission were randomly assigned to receive rIFN-gamma at a dose of 0.2 mg ( 4 x 10 ( 6 ) units ) once a day , subcutaneously , for 6 months , or observation only . In 31 patients , peripheral mononuclear cells were obtained prior to the study and at weeks 4 , 8 , and 12 for serial monitoring of immune response . By flow cytometric analysis , we identified the lymphocyte and monocyte populations using characteristic differences in electronic volume and right-angle scatter . In these populations , we determined the mean fluorescence channel after staining for CD14 ( antigen expressed on monocytes ) , CD3 ( antigen expressed on T lymphocytes ) , and HLA-DR ( HLA class II expressed by monocytes and activated lymphocytes ) . To determine the number of Fc receptors per cell , an Fc receptor assay was performed using the monocyte cell line U937 as a standard . At weeks 4 , 8 , and 12 , expression of HLA-DR and Fc receptors on monocytes in patients who received rIFN-gamma was significantly higher than that in untreated patients , and the difference was statistically significant . The number of Fc receptors per monocyte consistently increased during the rIFN-gamma treatment and reached a fivefold elevation at week 12 . There was no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte surface antigen expression between the treated and untreated groups . The dose of rIFN-gamma used in this study resulted in immune stimulation in patients with SCLC who had complete remission after induction therapy . The in vivo immunomodulatory activity of rIFN-gamma in such patients is characterized by a strong monocyte activation but no significant alteration in T-cell activation . \" \n",

Although postoperative atrial fibrillation often is regarded as a temporary , benign , operation-related problem , it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events , including transient or permanent stroke , acute myocardial infarction , and death . A total of 254 consecutively eligible enrolled patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer were included in this randomized , controlled , double-blinded trial . Patients received 300 mg of amiodarone or placebo intravenously over 20 minutes immediately after surgery and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily during the first 5 postoperative days . The patients in the amiodarone prophylaxis group had a reduction in the risk of atrial fibrillation of 23 % ( 12 to 31 ) ; number needed to treat was 4.4 ( 3.1 to 7.8 ) . A total of 38 in the control group and 11 in the amiodarone group experienced atrial fibrillation ( p < 0.001 ) . Adverse effects were observed in 10 patients equally distributed in both trial arms . Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe , practical , feasible , and effective regimen for patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery . It significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation . \" \n",

To determine whether interleukin-1 alpha could ameliorate carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia , we combined it with high-dose carboplatin in 43 patients with advanced neoplasms . High-dose carboplatin ( 800 mg per square meter of body-surface area ) was administered alone to a control group . Subsequent patients were randomly assigned to receive the same dose of carboplatin with interleukin-1 alpha , administered either before or after carboplatin . Interleukin-1 alpha was given intravenously at a dose of 0.03 , 0.1 , or 0.3 microgram per kilogram of body weight per day for five days . Carboplatin alone consistently produced thrombocytopenia with a median nadir of 19,000 platelets per cubic millimeter and a median of 10 days with less than 100,000 platelets per cubic millimeter . All 15 patients receiving interleukin-1 alpha before carboplatin had similar findings . In contrast , 5 of the 15 patients given one of the two higher doses of interleukin-1 alpha after carboplatin had minimal thrombocytopenia ( nadir , 91,000 to 332,000 platelets per cubic millimeter ) . In the 10 patients given 0.3 microgram of interleukin-1 alpha per kilogram after carboplatin treatment , the platelet count recovered to 100,000 per cubic millimeter significantly earlier than in either the control group ( P = 0.002 ) or the patients who received interleukin-1 alpha before carboplatin ( P = 0.003 ) , with the median times to recovery in the three groups being 16 , 21 , and 23 days , respectively . At the highest dose of interleukin-1 alpha , toxicity was substantial ( but reversible ) , requiring inpatient support for hypotension , supraventricular arrhythmias , and pulmonary-capillary leak . Interleukin-1 alpha can accelerate the recovery of platelets after high-dose carboplatin therapy and may be clinically useful in preventing or treating thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy . \" \n",

To prevent bladder tumour after nephroureterectomy with a single postoperative dose of intravesical mitomycin C ( MMC ) . A prospective , randomised , nonblinded trial ( ODMIT-C : One Dose Mitomycin C ) was undertaken in 46 British centres between July 2000 and December 2006 . The study recruited 284 patients with no previous or concurrent history of bladder cancer undergoing nephroureterectomy for suspected UUTUC . A single postoperative intravesical dose of MMC ( 40 mg in 40 ml saline ) or standard management on removal of the urinary catheter . Bladder tumour formation was judged by visual appearance at cystoscopy at 3 , 6 , and 12 mo following nephroureterectomy . One hundred forty-four patients were randomised to receive MMC and 140 patients to receive standard care . In the MMC arm , 105 of 144 patients ( 73 % ) and 115 of 140 patients ( 82 % ) in the standard care arm received their allocated treatment . Thirteen of 105 patients who received MMC and 20 of 115 patients allocated to standard treatment did not complete follow-up . By modified intention-to-treat analysis , 21 of 120 patients ( 17 % ) in the MMC arm developed a bladder recurrence in the first year compared to 32 of 119 patients ( 27 % ) in the standard treatment arm ( p = 0.055 ) . By treatment as per protocol analysis , 17 of 105 patients ( 16 % ) in the MMC arm and 31 of 115 patients ( 27 % ) in the standard treatment arm developed a recurrence ( p = 0.03 ) . No serious adverse events were reported . A limitation is that histologic proof of recurrence was not required in this trial . A single postoperative dose of intravesical MMC appears to reduce the risk of a bladder tumour within the first year following nephroureterectomy for UUTUC . The absolute reduction in risk is 11 % , the relative reduction in risk is 40 % , and the number needed to treat to prevent one bladder tumour is nine . \" \n",

Pathological response and toxicity of study treatment were evaluated , as well as expression of COX-2 and Ki67 in tumor tissue and IL-6 in plasma as possible molecular correlates and predictors of response to treatment . Patients treated with celecoxib tended to show a better response ( 61 % ) when compared to those treated with placebo ( 35 % ) , although not significant ( p = 0.13 ) . T-downstaging and N-downstaging were also slightly higher with celecoxib . Plasma IL-6 levels and intratumoral COX2 or Ki67 were altered by chemoradiation , but were not further altered by celecoxib treatment and therefore not useful for prediction of treatment benefit . Celecoxib therapy in conjunction with chemoradiation was not associated with additional toxicity and seemed to help mitigate therapy-related pain . Addition of celecoxib to preoperative chemoradiation is feasible for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer .

In both cohorts , cases were diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1989 and December 1997 . A partitioning of overall survival by variables associated with cancer onset such as age at diagnosis , stage at diagnosis , and grade at diagnosis was performed . Age at diagnosis , tumor extent at diagnosis , and grade at diagnosis were significantly different between the screened and clinically diagnosed cohort . The 5 - and 10-yr survival rates were higher in the screened cohort than in the clinically diagnosed cohort ( 88.8 % vs. 52.4 % , and 68.4 % vs. 29.6 % , respectively ) . Significant differences in survival were evident for all age , stage , and grade subgroups , except for metastatic disease at diagnosis . Differences in overall survival favoring the screened population were observed for all baseline characteristics ( age , stage , and grade of disease ) , and these variables may all explain differences in overall survival because screening achieves early diagnosis as well as a stage and grade shift . As observed survival rates in the screened population mirrored those within the general population , the contribution of lead time and overdiagnosis to final patient outcome is considered to be large as well . \" \n",

Predictors included demographic , medical , fitness , and quality of life variables . Exercise adherence was measured as the percentage of supervised exercise sessions completed . Overall adherence to the supervised exercise sessions was 73 % ( SD = 24 % ) . In a multivariate regression model , six independent predictors explained 26.4 % ( p < 0.001 ) of the variance in exercise adherence . Higher exercise adherence was achieved by breast cancer patients in Vancouver ( p < 0.001 ) , with fewer endocrine symptoms ( p = 0.009 ) , randomized to STAN ( p = 0.009 ) , with fewer exercise limitations ( p = 0.009 ) , receiving shorter chemotherapy protocols ( p = 0.015 ) , and with higher VO2peak ( p = 0.017 ) .

Carboplatin , a cisplatin analogue , is an active drug in testicular cancer with a more favourable spectrum of side effects . In a randomized trial , the German Testicular Cancer Study Group compared a combination regimen of carboplatin , etoposide and bleomycin ( CEB ) to standard cisplatin , etoposide and bleomycin ( PEB ) chemotherapy for patients with ` minimal - and moderate-disease non-seminomatous germ cell tumors , according to the Indiana University classification ., PEB was given for three cycles at standard doses ( given days 1-5 ) , and the CEB regimen consisted of carboplatin ( target AUC of 5 mg/ml x min ) on day 1 , etoposide 120 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 and bleomycin 30 mg on days 1 , 8 and 15 . Four cycles of CEB were given , with the omission of bleomycin in the fourth cycle . Thus , the cumulative doses of etoposide and bleomycin applied in the two treatment arms were comparable . Fifty-four patients were entered on the trial , 29 were treated with PEB and 25 with CEB chemotherapy . Patients were stratified according to disease extent ( minimal versus moderate ) and the degree of tumor marker elevation . Thirty-two patients ( 59 % ) belonged to the group with minimal disease and low markers . No significant difference in response to chemotherapy was seen between the two arms , with CR rates of 81 % for the PEB arm and 76 % for CEB treatment . However , more patients treated with CEB ( 32 % versus 13 % ) have relapsed after therapy , and 4 patients ( 16 % ) have died of disease progression after CEP in contrast to 1 ( 3 % ) after PEB therapy . The first interim analysis of negative events ( relapse , vital tumor at secondary resection , death from disease and therapy-associated death ) showed a significantly higher rate after CEB than after PEB therapy , and the trial was terminated early . After a median follow-up of 33 months for all patients , the calculation of negative events is still significantly in favour of PEB-treated patient , particularly since three late relapses > 2 years have been observed in the CEB arm ( P = 0.03 ) . This randomized trial demonstrates that even with the use of adequate doses of etoposide and full-dose bleomycin , carboplatin can not altogether replace cisplatin in patients with testicular cancer .

Naltrexone was given to all subjects to prevent potential fentanyl adverse drug reactions . Blood samples were frequently taken up to 72 hours post INFS administration and analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection . Primary pharmacokinetic parameters were area under the curve extrapolated to infinity ( AUC0 - ) and peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) . Statistical analyses of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters were performed using a linear mixed effect model applied to the natural log-transformed data . Healthy subjects showed very similar plasma concentration over time profiles for both delivery systems . The mean fentanyl Cmax and AUC0 - values for SDS and MDS were 948 pg/ml , 949 pg/ml and 4,439 pgh/ml , 4,489 pgh/ml . respectively . Point estimates ( and 90 % confidence intervals ) for AUC and Cmax were 0.97 ( 0.93 - 1.02 ) and 1.00 ( 0.92 - 1.09 ) and therefore in the bioequivalence range of 0.80 - 1.25 . Results of this study show that SDS and MDS met the pre-defined regulatory criteria for bioequivalence . Safety profiles were consistent between both devices and no safety concerns were identified with INFS administered in combination with oral naltrexone . \" \n",

The aim of our study was to compare follow-up mammographic findings , ultrasound and biopsy rates in each group . Follow-up imaging and breast biopsies of women from one centre participating in the TARGIT-A trial were independently reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the radiotherapy treatment received . The cohort consisted of 141 patients ( EBRT n = 80/IORT n = 61 ) . There was no significant difference in the patient or disease characteristics of the two groups . The number of follow-up mammograms and length of follow-up was similar ( EBRT/IORT n = 2.0 / 2.4 ; 4.3 yr/5 .1 yr ; p = 0.386 ( 2 ) test ) . There were no significant differences in mammographic scar or calcification appearances of the post-operative site . Generalised increase in breast density and skin thickening were more common in the EBRT compared to the IORT group ( p = 0.002 ; p = 0.030 , ( 2 ) test respectively ) . A trend towards additional ultrasound at follow-up was observed in the IORT group ( 15 of 61  24.6 %  versus 11 of 80  13.8 %  ) , however this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.100 ( 2 ) test ) . No disease recurrence was demonstrated on any of the breast biopsies taken . Only one biopsy was reported as fat necrosis in the IORT group . Mammographic changes were more common following EBRT , although more additional follow-up ultrasounds were performed in the IORT group . IORT is not detrimental to subsequent radiological follow up . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Physical inactivity and a poor diet predict lifestyle diseases such as diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and certain types of cancer . Marked declines in physical activity occur during late adolescence , coinciding with the point at which many young people leave school and enter the workforce and begin to take greater control over their lifestyle behaviours . The work outlined within this paper sought to test a theoretically-informed intervention aimed at supporting increased engagement in physical activity and healthy eating habits in young people at the point of transition from school to work or work-based learning . As actively engaging young people in initiatives based on health messages is challenging , we also tested the efficacy of financial incentives in promoting initial engagement with the programme . A three-arm cluster-randomised design was used . Participants were school pupils from Year 11 and 13 ( i.e. , in their final year of study ) , aged 16-18years . To reduce contamination effects , the unit of randomisation was school . Participants were randomly allocated to receive ( i ) a 12-week behavioural support intervention consisting of six appointments , ( ii ) a behavioural support intervention plus incentives ( totalling 40 ) , or ( iii ) an information-only control group . Behavioural support was provided by fitness advisors at local leisure centres following an initial consultation with a dietician . Sessions focused on promoting habit formation through setting implementation intentions as part of an incremental goal setting process . Consistent with self-determination theory , all advisors were trained to provide guidance in an autonomy-supportive manner so that they were equipped to create a social context supportive of autonomous forms of participant motivation . The primary outcome was objectively assessed physical activity ( via GT1M accelerometers ) . Secondary outcome measures were diet , motivation and habit strength . Data were collected at baseline , post-intervention ( 12weeks ) and 12months . Findings of this trial will provide valuable insight into the feasibility of promoting autonomous engagement in healthy physical activity and dietary habits among school leavers . The research also provides much needed data and detailed information related to the use of incentives for the initial promotion of young peoples behaviour change during this important transition ., The trial is registered as Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN55839517 . \" \n",

Tropisetron is a new 5HT3 receptor antagonist and is successfully used in paediatric patients receiving cancer therapy . The aim of the study was to assess efficacy and safety of a single intravenous dose of tropisetron for prevention of PONV in paediatric patients at risk for postoperative vomiting . In a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , we studied 98 children aged 2-12 years undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy . Patients received placebo or tropisetron 0.1 mg ( = 0.1 ml ) / kg body weight immediately after induction of anesthesia . A standard general anesthetic technique ( Sevoflurane/N2O/O2 without neuromuscular blockers or opioids ) was used . Perioperative vital signs , grade of sedation and episodes of postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded . No vomiting episodes occurred in 65.3 % of the tropisetron treated patients compared to 34.7 % of the placebo group ( p = 0.0024 ) . Only 10.2 % of the tropisetron treated patients vomited more than 3 times compared to 22.4 % of the control patients ( p = 0.0004 ) . The need for antiemetic rescue medication was significantly lower in the study group ( 10.4 % ) compared to 28.6 % ( p = 0.025 ) . No significant adverse effects of the study medication were shown . A single intravenous prophylactic dose of tropisetron effectively reduces the incidence of PONV during the first 24 postoperative hours after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy . Because of the low incidence of adverse effects , the prophylactic use of tropisetron seems to be safe and justified in paediatric surgical patients at high risk for postoperative vomiting . \" \n",

Three hundred and six women prescribed whole breast radiotherapy after tumour excision for early stage cancer were randomised to 3D IMRT ( test arm ) or 2D radiotherapy delivered using standard wedge compensators ( control arm ) . All patients were treated with 6 or 10MV photons to a dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions to 100 % in 5 weeks followed by an electron boost to the tumour bed of 11.1 Gy in 5 fractions to 100 % . The primary endpoint was change in breast appearance scored from serial photographs taken before radiotherapy and at 1 , 2 and 5 years follow up . Secondary endpoints included patient self-assessments of breast discomfort , breast hardness , quality of life and physician assessments of breast induration . Analysis was by intention to treat . 240 ( 79 % ) patients with 5-year photographs were available for analysis . Change in breast appearance was identified in 71/122 ( 58 % ) allocated standard 2D treatment compared to only 47/118 ( 40 % ) patients allocated 3D IMRT . The control arm patients were 1.7 times more likely to have a change in breast appearance than the IMRT arm patients after adjustment for year of photographic assessment ( 95 % confidence interval 1.2-2 .5 , p = 0.008 ) . Significantly fewer patients in the 3D IMRT group developed palpable induration assessed clinically in the centre of the breast , pectoral fold , infra-mammary fold and at the boost site . No significant differences between treatment groups were found in patient reported breast discomfort , breast hardness or quality of life . This analysis suggests that minimisation of unwanted radiation dose inhomogeneity in the breast reduces late adverse effects . Incidence of change in breast appearance was statistically significantly higher in patients in the standard 2D treatment arm compared with the IMRT arm . A beneficial effect on quality of life remains to be demonstrated . \" \n",

Ninety percent of men with prostate cancer are over aged 60 years , diagnosed by early detection with the prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) blood test and have disease believed confined to the prostate gland ( clinically localized ) . Common treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer include watchful waiting surgery to remove the prostate gland ( radical prostatectomy ) , external beam radiation therapy and interstitial radiation therapy ( brachytherapy ) and androgen deprivation . Little is known about the relative effectiveness and harms of treatments due to the paucity of randomized controlled trials . The VA/NCI/AHRQ Cooperative Studies Program Study # 407 : Prostate cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial ( PIVOT ) , initiated in 1994 , is a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting in men with clinically localized prostate cancer . We describe the study rationale , design , recruitment methods and baseline characteristics of PIVOT enrollees . We provide comparisons with eligible men declining enrollment and men participating in another recently reported randomized trial of radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting conducted in Scandinavia . We screened 13,022 men with prostate cancer at 52 United States medical centers for potential enrollment . From these , 5023 met initial age , comorbidity and disease eligibility criteria and a total of 731 men agreed to participate and were randomized . The mean age of enrollees was 67 years . Nearly one-third were African-American . Approximately 85 % reported they were fully active . The median prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) was 7.8 ng/mL ( mean 10.2 ng/mL ) . In three-fourths of men the primary reason for biopsy leading to a diagnosis of prostate cancer was a PSA elevation or rise . Using previously developed tumor risk categorizations incorporating PSA levels , Gleason histologic grade and tumor stage , approximately 43 % had low risk , 36 % had medium risk and 20 % had high-risk prostate cancer . Comparison to our national sample of eligible men declining PIVOT participation as well as to men enrolled in the Scandinavian trial indicated that PIVOT enrollees are representative of men being diagnosed and treated in the U.S. and quite different from men in the Scandinavian trial . PIVOT enrolled an ethnically diverse population representative of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States . Results will yield important information regarding the relative effectiveness and harms of surgery compared to watchful waiting for men with predominately PSA detected clinically localized prostate cancer . \" \n",

A higher metastasis rate was observed in the alkylating ( A ) group . Cisplatin and mitolactol in combination with BVM showed higher local control and lower disease-free survival than BVM alone . That was mostly due to a higher rate of regional metastatis formation in the alkylating-treated patients .

The proportion of subjects who were eligible among all those approached ranged from 25 % to more than 70 % ( in the community setting ) . Recruitment rates were very high ( 78 % -100 % of eligible individuals approached ) and the proportion who refused or who were not interested among those approached was very low ( 5 % -11 % ) . Recruitment strategies used by the CNPCs were associated with low refusal and high enrollment ratios of potential subjects .

Patients were interviewed by telephone by a trained interviewer from the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study Coordinating Center at baseline ( prior to randomization ) , at 6 months , and on annual anniversaries of enrollment . The questionnaire battery included the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 , the Activities of Daily Vision Scale , the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire , and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale . Additional questions concerning satisfaction with posttreatment appearance and concerns about cancer recurrence also were included in posttreatment interviews . There was a significant increase in both treatment groups in levels of reported difficulty for most vision-oriented activities , and in bodily and ocular pain , 6 months following treatment . Differences in visual function between treatment groups reported during follow-up were relatively small , but significant differences favoring brachytherapy-treated patients were observed for driving during the first year of follow-up and for peripheral vision during the first 2 years of follow-up . Anxiety levels in both groups decreased significantly following treatment , but patients treated with brachytherapy with symptoms of anxiety were less likely to report later resolution of symptoms than patients with symptoms of anxiety who were treated with enucleation . This study was unable to assess impact of treatment on satisfaction with appearance and concern about cancer recurrence during the first year after treatment , but no treatment-related differences were found on these measures at 2 years and later follow-up times . Patients treated with brachytherapy reported significantly better visual function than patients treated with enucleation with respect to driving and peripheral vision for up to 2 years following treatment . Differences between treatments in visual function diminished by 3 to 5 years posttreatment , paralleling decline in visual acuity in brachytherapy-treated eyes . Patients treated with brachytherapy were more likely to have symptoms of anxiety during follow-up than patients treated with enucleation . Given that no significant differences in survival between enucleation and brachytherapy have been found , the differences demonstrated here for driving and anxiety will allow the individual patient and physician to make informed choices regarding treatment based on personal preferences . \" \n",

Fulvestrant was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly thereafter . The primary end point was progression-free survival , with overall survival designated as a prespecified secondary outcome . The median progression-free survival was 13.5 months in group 1 and 15.0 months in group 2 ( hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy , 0.80 ; 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.68 to 0.94 ; P = 0.007 by the log-rank test ) . The combination therapy was generally more effective than anastrozole alone in all subgroups , with no significant interactions .

The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between anxiety and adherence to breast self-examination by comparing the impact of general anxiety with that of cancer-specific anxiety on BSE frequency . A sample of at-risk women ( N = 833 ) completed a questionnaire regarding BSE frequency , general anxiety , breast cancer worries , perceived risk of breast cancer , and family history of breast cancer . Women who self-examined infrequently ( N = 211 ) , appropriately ( N = 462 ) , or excessively ( N = 156 ) were compared on these variables . Statistical analyses indicated that general anxiety differentiated only between excessive self-examiners and less frequent self-examiners , with excessive self-examiners reporting significantly higher general anxiety . Breast cancer worries differentiated between all three groups in a linear fashion , with increasing cancer worries associated with higher levels of BSE . In some at-risk women , high cancer anxiety may lead to high general anxiety and precipitate hypervigilant breast self-examination rather than avoidance .

MR scan protocol included turbo spin echo ( TSE ) T2-weighted sequences in the axial , sagittal and coronal planes ; three-dimensional ( 3D ) chemical shift imaging ( CSI ) sequences with spectral/spatial pulses optimized for quantitative detection of choline and citrate ; dynamic contrast enhanced gradient-echo ( GRE ) T1-weighted sequence . The population was divided into two groups . Group A included 28 patients with a lesion size ranging between 5.00 mm and 7.2 mm and PSA reduction following radiation therapy . Group B included 56 patients with a lesion size between 7.6 mm and 19.4 mm . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) and accuracy were evaluated and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were performed . In Group A combined 1H-MRSI and DCE-MRI showed a sensitivity of 92 % , a specificity of 75 % ( PPV 96 % ) while PET-CT examination showed a sensitivity of 62 % and a specificity of 50 % ( PPV 88 % ) in identifying local recurrence . The accuracy of MRI was 89 % while PET-CT showed an accuracy of 60 % . Areas under the ROC curve ( AUC ) values for MR and PET-CT were 0.833 and 0.562 , respectively . In Group B combined 1H-MRSI and DCEMR showed a sensitivity of 94 % and a specificity of 100 % ( PPV 100 % ) with accuracy of 94 % . PET-CT had a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 33 % ( PPV 98 % ) with accuracy of 91 % . The AUCs for MR and PET-CT values were 0.971 and 0.837 , respectively . The diagnostic accuracy of combined 1HMRSI-DCEMR was higher than PET/CT to identify local prostate cancer recurrence , mostly in patients with low biochemical progression after RRP ( 0.2-2ng / mL ) . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Neutropenic patients with cancer are traditionally treated with empiric antibiotic combinations when they become febrile . The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime and imipenem has made it possible to initiate therapy with a single agent ( monotherapy ) . The objectives of this trial were to compare ceftazidime and imipenem as single agents for the therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients and to ascertain whether the addition of an aminoglycoside ( amikacin ) to either of these agents would provide an advantage . A prospective clinical trial was conducted in which eligible neutropenic patients with cancer were randomized to one of four treatment arms : ceftazidime alone ; imipenem alone ; ceftazidime plus amikacin ; and imipenem plus amikacin . Efficacy analysis was done for 750 assessable episodes . A multivariate logistic-regression analysis was also performed to examine the unique contribution of various prognostic factors . The overall response rates were 76 % with imipenem plus amikacin , 72 % with imipenem , 71 % with ceftazidime plus amikacin , and 59 % with ceftazidime alone . Single-organism gram-positive infections occurred in 101 of 750 episodes . Without a change in antibiotics , the response rates were 50 % with imipenem , 40 % with imipenem plus amikacin , 39 % with ceftazidime plus amikacin , and 38 % with ceftazidime . Most responded to vancomycin or other antibiotics , and the mortality associated with gram-positive infections was only 5 % . Regardless of the antibiotic regimen , the majority of uncomplicated gram-negative infections responded to therapy and the majority of complicated gram-negative infections failed to respond . Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed that recovery of the neutrophil count was the most favorable prognostic factor in a patient s response to infection , whereas the presence of gram-positive infection , acute leukemia , pulmonary or enteric infection , and therapy with ceftazidime were unfavorable factors ., Single-agent therapy with imipenem is as effective as more conventional combination antibiotic therapy for the empirical treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with cancer . \" \n",

The primary outcome was depression as assessed by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ( CES-D ) ; the main secondary outcomes were : anxiety as assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales ( HADS-A ) ; overall quality of life and fatigue as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General and Fatigue scales ( FACT-G and FACT-F , respectively ) ; and clinicians ratings of quality of life by use of Spizter s Quality of Life Index ( SQLI ) ., Multiple measures were used for corroboration of the most important outcomes . Primary analyses were done by intention to treat and were based on scale scores at 4 weeks and 8 weeks .

We found that the incidence of gastric cancer development at the population level was similar between participants receiving H pylori eradication treatment and those receiving placebo during a period of 7.5 years in a high-risk region of China . In the subgroup of H pylori carriers without precancerous lesions , eradication of H pylori significantly decreased the development of gastric cancer .

A prospective follow-up study in 21 Dutch long-term care facilities . 890 LTCF residents , median age 84 ( Interquartile range 79-88 ) years participated . At baseline , 6 and 12 months , care dependency was assessed by the nursing staff with the Care Dependency Scale ( CDS ) , range 15-75 points . Since the median CDS score differed between men and women ( 47.5 vs. 43.0 , P = 0.013 ) , CDS groups ( low , middle and high ) were based on gender-specific 33 % of CDS scores at baseline and 6 months . At baseline , the CDS groups differed in median length of stay on the ward , urine incontinence and dementia ( all P < 0.001 ) ; participants in the low CDS group stayed longer , had more frequent urine incontinence and more dementia . They had also the highest mortality rate ( log rank 32.2 ; df = 2 ; P for trend < 0.001 ) . Per point lower in CDS score , the mortality risk increased with 2 % ( 95 % CI 1 % -3 % ) . Adjustment for age , gender , cranberry use , LTCF , length of stay , comorbidity and dementia showed similar results . A one point decrease in CDS score between 0 and 6 months was related to an increased mortality risk of 4 % ( 95 % CI 3 % -6 % ) . At the 6-month follow-up , 10 % improved to a higher CDS group , 65 % were in the same , and 25 % had deteriorated to a lower CDS group ; a similar pattern emerged at 12-month follow-up . Gender , age , urine incontinence , dementia , cancer and baseline care dependency status , predicted an increase in care dependency over time . The majority of residents were stable in their care dependency status over two subsequent 6-month periods . Highly care dependent residents showed an increased mortality risk .

The evaluation was carried out on the day before the operation and on the first 5 postoperative days . Particular attention also was paid to the episodes of arterial hypotension and hemoglobin oxygen desaturation during the 1st postoperative night . Pain relief was significantly better in the EP group than in the SC group ( P < 0.05 ) especially during recovery and on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days . In the EP group , vital capacity decreased less on the 1st postoperative day ( P < 0.05 ) and arterial oxygen tension was greater in the recovery room ( P < 0.05 ) .

Non-metastatic breast cancer patients ( n = 222 , mean age 55 years ) were categorized into four subgroups according to their treatment status . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) was used to measure patients cardiorespiratory fitness , including oxygen delivery and metabolic muscle function ., Testing was performed by bicycle ergometry , and maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) was measured . Heart rate during exercise at 50 watts ( HR50 ) was assessed as a cardiocirculatory parameter and ventilatory threshold ( VT ) was used as an indicator of the O2 supply to muscle . Analysis of covariance was used to estimate the impact of different cancer treatments on cardiorespiratory fitness with adjustment for clinical factors . Submaximal measures were successfully assessed in 220 ( 99 % ) and 200 ( 90 % ) patients for HR50 and VT , while criteria for maximal exercise testing were met by 176 patients ( 79 % ) , respectively . The mean VO2peak was 20.6 6.7 ml/kg/min , mean VT 10.7 2.9 ml/min/kg and mean HR50 112 16 beats/min . Chemotherapy was significantly associated with decreased VO2peak , with significantly lower adjusted mean VO2peak among patients post adjuvant chemotherapy compared to patients with no chemotherapy or those who just started chemotherapy regime ( all p < 0.01 ) . Patients post adjuvant chemotherapy reached only 63 % of the VO2peak level expected for their age - and BMI-category ( mean VO2peak 15.5 4.8 ml/kg/min ) . Similarly , HR50 was significantly associated with treatment . However , VT was not associated with treatment . Breast cancer patients have marked and significantly impaired cardiopulmonary function during and after chemotherapy . Hereby , chemotherapy appears to impair cardiorespiratory fitness by influencing the oxygen delivery system rather than impacting metabolic muscle function . Our findings underline the need of exercise training in breast cancer patients to counteract the loss of cardiorespiratory fitness during the anti-cancer treatment . \" \n",

Patients in the 2 groups were similar with respect to age , Bloom-Richardson score , estrogen receptor status , use of adjuvant systemic therapy , tumor type , T stage , and tumor size . Patients randomized to SLND + ALND had a median of 17 axillary nodes removed compared with a median of only 2 SN removed with SLND alone ( P < 0.001 ) . ALND also removed more positive lymph nodes ( P < 0.001 ) . At a median follow-up time of 6.3 years , there were no statistically significant differences in local recurrence ( P = 0.11 ) or regional recurrence ( P = 0.45 ) between the 2 groups .

The ICER of this strategy versus the next best alternative , nurse-led telephone follow-up plus EGP ( 0.772 QALYs and 3971 ) , amounted to 235.750 / QALY . Hospital and telephone follow-up without EGP both incurred higher costs and less QALYs than telephone follow-up plus EGP and were judged inferior . Hospital follow-up plus EGP was not considered cost-effective , therefore , telephone follow-up plus EGP was the preferred strategy . The probability of telephone follow-up plus EGP being cost-effective ranged from 49 % to 62 % for different QALY threshold values . Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust . Nurse-led telephone follow-up plus EGP seems an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to hospital follow-up for breast cancer patients during their first year after treatment . \" \n",

Metformin might reduce cancer growth through direct antiproliferative effects or through indirect mechanisms , particularly the reduction of insulin . In a randomized study on nondiabetic BC patients in natural menopause with hightestosterone levels , we observed a significant decrease in insulin and in testosterone levels with metformin 1500mg/d compared with 1000 mg/d . We present the results of a new analysis of our study on the effect of metformin on the bioavailability of sex hormones . One hundred twenty-four eligible women were initiallyinvited to take metformin 500 mg/d for 3 months . The 108 women who completed the first 3 months continued the study using 1000 mg/d for 1 month . The women were then randomized into 2 groups , and , for the subsequent 5months , 1 group increased the dose to 1500 mg/d , and the other group continued with 1000 mg/d . Ninety-six women completed the study , 43 receiving metformin 1500 mg/day , and 53 receiving 1000 mg/day . The women receiving 1500 mg/d showed a greater and significant reduction of free testosterone ( -29 % ) and estradiol ( -38 % ) , a borderline significant reduction of estrone and insulin-like growth factor-1 , and a nonsignificant reduction of androstenedione . They also showed a nonsignificant increase of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . Metformin does not interfere with the production of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . Besides , it decreases estradiol levels , basically through the reduction of testosterone . These hormonal changes might have clinical relevance . \" \n",

Randomized clinical trial allocating breast cancer patients to two alternative follow-up protocols ( intensive vs clinical ) for at least 5 years . Twelve breast clinics ( referral centers ) in different areas in Italy . A total of 1243 consecutive patients ( either premenopausal or postmenopausal ) surgically treated for unilateral invasive breast carcinoma with no evidence of metastases . The two study groups were well balanced in terms of clinical and prognostic characteristics . Patients in both treatment groups had physical examination and mammography , while patients of the intensive follow-up group had , in addition , chest roentgenography and bone scan every 6 months . Vital status at 5 years was the main outcome ; information was available for all except five patients ( 0.4 % ) . Relapse-free survival was also analyzed . Overall , 393 recurrences ( 104 local and 289 distant ) were observed during the study . Increased detection of isolated intrathoracic and bone metastases was evident in the intensive follow-up group compared with the clinical follow-up group ( 112 vs 71 cases ) , while no difference was observed for other sites and for local and/or regional recurrences . The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was significantly higher for the clinical follow-up group , with patients in the intensive follow-up group showing earlier detection of recurrences . No difference in 5-year overall mortality ( 18.6 % vs 19.5 % ) was observed between the two follow-up groups . Periodic chest roentgenography and bone scan allow earlier detection of distant metastases , but anticipated diagnosis appears to be the only effect of intensive follow-up , and no impact on prognosis is evident after 5 years . Periodic intensive follow-up with chest roentgenography and bone scan should not be recommended as a routine policy . \" \n",

Late ( 90 days after completion of radiation therapy ) genitourinary ( GU ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity were prospectively evaluated and scored according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria . 101 men received CIMRT and 102 men received HIMRT . The median age was 68 , and the median follow-up time was 6.0 years . Twenty-eight percent had low-risk , 71 % had intermediate-risk , and 1 % had high-risk disease . There was no difference in late GU toxicity in men treated with CIMRT and HIMRT . The actuarial 5-year grade 2 GU toxicity was 16.5 % after CIMRT and 15.8 % after HIMRT ( P = .97 ) . There was a nonsignificant numeric increase in late GI toxicity in men treated with HIMRT compared with men treated with CIMRT . The actuarial 5-year grade 2 GI toxicity was 5.1 % after CIMRT and 10.0 % after HIMRT ( P = .11 ) .

We investigated the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) to protect progenitor cells in the bone marrow of cancer patients from the toxic effects of subsequent treatments with chemotherapeutic agents . Thirty-six patients with histologically documented , locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin once every 3 weeks at a dose of 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 , with G-CSF administered either before and after chemotherapy ( 18 patients ) or after chemotherapy only ( 18 patients ) . For prechemotherapy administration of G-CSF , recombinant human methionyl ( r-met Hu ) G-CSF was administered subcutaneously to patients twice per day for 5 days at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg , with the last dose given 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy . For postchemotherapy administration of G-CSF , r-met Hu G-CSF was administered subcutaneously to patients once per day for 7 days at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg , with the first dose given 24 hours after chemotherapy . The incidence or the duration of grade 4 neutropenia was not reduced in all patients by the use of prechemotherapy G-CSF ; the incidence over all cycles of chemotherapy was 74 % for patients treated with prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy G-CSF and 66 % for patients treated with postchemotherapy G-CSF only ( two-sided P , adjusted for dose = .21 ) and the median duration in both treatment arms was 3 days ( two-sided P = .19 ) . Unexpectedly , the incidence of grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was much greater in patients who received prechemotherapy G-CSF compared with those who did not ( 54 % versus 6 % , respectively , over all chemotherapy cycles ; two-sided P , adjusted for dose < .001 ) . No difference in the decrease in hemoglobin level ( adjusted for red blood cell transfusions ) between patients in the two treatment arms was observed . No beneficial effects were associated with the administration of G-CSF to cancer patients prior to chemotherapy . The observation of more severe thrombocytopenia in patients treated with prechemotherapy G-CSF led us to conclude that the proliferation of progenitor cells was still increased 48 hours after the last dose of G-CSF and that the administration of chemotherapy at or within this time period actually worsens the toxic effects on bone marrow . This result has important ramifications for the design of clinical cancer treatment protocols , especially those that involve shortened intervals between cycles of chemotherapeutic agent administration . \" \n",

Massage therapy is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative therapies used in the hope of alleviating such stress and physical and psychological complaints and to improve health-related quality of life . This randomized phase III , two-armed , parallel group , clinical trial was designed after obtaining positive findings in a preliminary study . The primary objective is to verify the effects of continuous Japanese massage therapy , referred to as Anma therapy , for cancer survivors . The secondary objective is to confirm the immediate effects of a single Anma massage session for cancer survivors . Sixty cancer survivors older than 20 years of age who have had histologically confirmed uterine cervical , endometrial , ovarian , fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer in the past , but with no recurrence for more than 3 years since receiving standard medical treatment , are being recruited by gynecologists in medical facilities . In the coordinating office , they are randomly allocated to two groups ( n = 30 each ) : an Anma massage group receiving a 40-min Anma massage session once weekly over a 2-month intervention period ( total of eight Anma massage sessions ) and a control group being followed by medical doctors and receiving no Anma massage sessions . The primary end point is the severity of physical subjective symptoms that cancer survivors report in daily life , assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale . Secondary end points are urine and saliva analyses , psychological condition and health-related quality-of-life scores as determined on the basis of a self-report questionnaire . Using the evidence-based findings of this trial , medical professionals should be able to explain the benefits conferred by Anma massage to cancer survivors and provide higher-quality information to better inform patients regarding their decisions about whether to receive such therapy .

Eighty subjects were nonrandomly assigned to a three-arm trial to either bicalutamide 50 mg/wk ( n = 26 ) or 100 mg/wk ( n = 28 ) or no treatment ( n = 26 ) for 6 months . Blood samples were obtained at 0 , 3 , and 6 months , and prostate biopsies were repeated after 6 months . The outcome measures were 6-month changes of tissue Ki-67 ( primary end point ) , high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( HG-PIN ) , proliferative inflammatory atrophy , circulating PSA , and sex hormones . Ki-67 expression was higher in HG-PIN than in normal tissue ( 10 % versus 3 % ; P < 0.01 ) but was not modulated by bicalutamide in normal luminal cells . A trend toward an improvement of HG-PIN status was found in treated subjects ( 26 % improved , 60 % had no change , 15 % worsened ) as compared with the no-treatment arm ( 4 % improved , 83 % had no change , 13 % worsened ; P = 0.07 ) . Proliferative inflammatory atrophy prevalence was not reduced by bicalutamide . Bicalutamide reduced PSA by 50 % in both arms and raised testosterone and estradiol levels . Asymptomatic breast swelling was noted in 40 % of the treated cases . A weekly administration of bicalutamide seems to be reasonably safe and shows an encouraging signal of activity on HG-PIN prevalence , supporting further studies of this schedule in men at high risk despite the negative primary end-point findings on Ki-67 . \" \n",

Eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive either cisplatin 50 mg/m2 q 3 weeks ( C ) or cisplatin 50 mg/m2 day 1 and topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 days 1-3 q 3 weeks ( TC ) or methotrexate 30 mg/m2 days 1 , 15 , and 22 , vinblastine 3 mg/m2 days 2 , 15 , and 22 , doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 day 2 , and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 2 q 4 weeks ( MVAC ) . QOL was assessed at four time points using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix ( FACT-Cx ) , Neurotoxicity Subscale ( FACT/GOG-NTX subscale ) , and Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . One hundred eighty-six patients ( C = 60 ; TC = 63 ; MVAC = 63 ) were enrolled before MVAC was closed by the GOG Data Safety Monitoring Board after four treatment-related deaths occurred on that arm . MVAC produced a 22 % overall response rate ( 95 % CI : 0.13 to 0.34 ) and median PFS and OS of 4.4 months and 9.4 months , respectively . Compared with C and TC , there was more hematologic toxicity with MVAC . There were no appreciable differences in QOL scores after controlling for baseline scores . MVAC s clinical activity tended to be similar to that of TC but with an unacceptable risk of death from sepsis at this dose and schedule ., Nevertheless , QOL , as measured by these instruments , was not substantially impaired by this regimen . \" \n",

The ABCSG-8 ( Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 8 ) study is a large phase III clinical trial addressing the sequence strategy containing ANA in comparison with 5 years of TAM in a low - to intermediate-risk group of postmenopausal patients . Endocrine receptor-positive patients with G1 or G2 tumors were eligible . After surgery , patients were randomly assigned to 5 years of TAM or 2 years of TAM followed by 3 years of ANA . Adjuvant chemotherapy and G3 and T4 tumors were exclusion criteria . Intention-to-treat and censored analyses of on-treatment recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) were performed , and exploratory survival end points and toxicity were investigated . Information from 3,714 patients , including 17,563 woman-years , with a median of 60 months of follow-up was available for this analysis . Median age was 63.8 years , 75 % were node negative , and 75 % had T1 tumors . Sequencing of ANA after identical 2-year treatment with TAM in both arms did not result in a statistically significant improvement of RFS ( hazard ratio  HR  , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.63 to 1.01 ; P = .06 ) . Exploratory analyses of distant relapse-free survival indicated a 22 % improvement ( HR , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 to 1.00 ) . On-treatment adverse events and serious adverse events were consistent with known toxicity profiles of ANA and TAM treatment . Despite a low overall rate of recurrence in a population with breast cancer at limited risk of relapse , the a priori sequence strategy of 2 years of TAM followed by 3 years of ANA led to small outcome and toxicity benefits . \" \n",

A secondary aim was to assess if a higher dose ( 10 mcg/kg/day ) of G-CSF is more efficacious than the conventional dose ( 5 mcg/kg/day ) in this setting . Female patients with early-stage , node-positive invasive breast cancer were eligible for this multicenter , cooperative group feasibility trial that was designed as the pilot study for a larger randomized clinical trial . The protocol treatment comprised five cycles of dose-intensified AC ( 75 and 2000 mg/m ( 2 ) / cycle , respectively , intravenously every three weeks ) with G-CSF support , followed by an additional four cycles of T ( 175 mg/m ( 2 ) by 3h intravenous infusion , every three weeks ) . Patients were randomized to receive one of two dose levels of G-CSF ( 5 vs. 10 mcg/kg/day ) during AC chemotherapy . Data on both short-term toxicity and long-term survival were collected . One hundred and seventy two node-positive patients with operable primary breast cancer were accrued to this trial between February 1993 and April 1994.130 of the 172 patients ( 76 % ) completed all protocol-specified therapy . Of the 42 early study withdrawals , 23 were due to unacceptable acute treatment-related toxicity . No differences in toxicities or clinical outcomes were noted between the two different dose levels of G-CSF support . At 6.8 years median follow-up , relapse-free survival ( RFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) rates for all patients are 70 % and 78 % , respectively . Ten patients developed second malignancies during follow-up , including three cases with a hematologic malignancy ( 2 % incidence ) . The delivery of dose-intensified AC followed by T was feasible in this large-scale pilot trial , although significant acute toxicities were commonly encountered . The data confirmed the acceptable tolerability of T after aggressive myelotoxic therapy in the adjuvant setting , leading to a larger randomized clinical trial comparing three dose levels of doxorubicin in AC with or without the addition of T ( CALGB 9344 ) . Supportive care using twice the conventional dose of G-CSF did not significantly improve the tolerability or change the toxicities of this regimen , and the occurrence of secondary malignancies is consistent with the emerging risk profile of dose-intensive regimens with growth factor support . With long-term follow-up , the clinical outcomes remain relatively favorable and correlate with such expected prognostic factors as the number of involved nodes and hormone receptor status . \" \n",

Patients who received IFN 2b had significantly worse anemia , neutropenia , diarrhea , anorexia , weight loss , flu-like syndrome , and psychological reactions . Based on this final analysis , the addition of IFN 2b to the combination of 5-FU and FA enhances toxicity and contributes to decreased survival . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Xerostomia ( dry mouth ) after head/neck radiation is a common problem among cancer patients , and available treatments are of little benefit . The objective of this trial was to determine whether acupuncture can prevent xerostomia among head/neck patients undergoing radiotherapy . A randomized , controlled trial among patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was conducted comparing acupuncture to standard care . Participants were treated at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center , Shanghai , China . Forty patients were randomized to acupuncture treatment and 46 to standard care . Patients were treated 3/wk on the same days they received radiotherapy . Subjective measures included the Xerostomia Questionnaire and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck ( MDASI-HN ) . Objective measures were unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates . Patients were followed for 6 months after the end of radiotherapy . Xerostomia Questionnaire scores for acupuncture were statistically significantly lower than for controls starting in week 3 through the 6 months ( P = .003 at week 3 , all other P < .0001 ) , with clinically significant differences as follows : week 11 , relative risk ( RR ) 0.63 ( 95 % confidence interval  CI  , 0.45-0 .87 ) ; 6 months , RR 0.38 ( 95 % CI , 0.19-0 .76 ) . Similar findings were seen for MDASI-HN scores . Group differences emerged as early as 3 weeks into treatment for saliva ( unstimulated whole salivary flow rate , P = .0004 ) , with greater saliva flow in the acupuncture group at week 7 ( unstimulated whole salivary flow rate , P < .0001 ; stimulated whole salivary flow rate , P = .002 ) and 11 ( unstimulated whole salivary flow rate , P < .02 ; stimulated whole salivary flow rate , P < .03 ) and at 6 months ( stimulated whole salivary flow rate , P < .003 ) . Acupuncture given concurrently with radiotherapy significantly reduced xerostomia and improved quality of life . \" \n",

One hundred and fifty-four eligible patients were treated with either letrozole 1.0 mg once daily ( n = 77 ) or fadrozole 1.0 mg twice daily ( n = 77 ) , for a minimum of 8 weeks . Letrozole showed a significantly higher overall objective response rate  complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR )  than fadrozole ( 31.2 % and 13.0 % , respectively ; P = 0.011 , Fisher s exact test ) ., Clinical benefits defined as CR , PR and stable disease ( no change in status for more than 24 weeks ) were also higher in patients treated with letrozole ( 50.6 % ) than fadrozole ( 35.1 % ) . Letrozole was significantly superior to fadrozole in terms of the dominant lesion in soft tissue , bone and viscera ( P = 0.011 , stratified Mantel-Haenszel test ) . Median time to progression was 211 days in the letrozole group and 113 days in the fadrozole group with no significant difference ( P = 0.175 , log-rank test ) . Letrozole markedly reduced the estradiol , estrone and estrone sulfate levels in peripheral blood within 4 weeks . The suppressive effect of fadrozole on these hormone levels was insufficient . Adverse drug reactions were observed in 35.9 % of the patients treated with letrozole and in 39.5 % of those treated with fadrozole with no significant difference between the two groups ( P = 0.74 , Fisher s exact test ) ., Most of the adverse drug reactions were rated as grade 1 or 2 . The results show letrozole at a dose of 1.0 mg once daily to be more effective in treating postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer than fadrozole at 1.0 mg twice daily , with similar safety and tolerability profiles . \" \n",

This report presents the clinical results with a median follow-up of 60 months . Between February 1996 and April 2000 , 716 patients were entered onto this trial . Adjuvant treatment began within 6 weeks after surgery . Sequential treatment of CT administered first followed by RT was compared with concurrent treatment of CT administered with RT. . The CT regimen consisted of mitoxantrone ( 12 mg/m2 ) , fluorouracil ( 500 mg/m2 ) , and cyclophosphamide ( 500 mg/m2 ) on day 1 , and it was repeated every 21 days for six courses . RT was delivered to the breast and , when indicated , to the regional lymphatics . There was no statistically significant difference in treatment in the 5-year DFS ( 80 % in both groups ; P = .83 ) , locoregional recurrence-free survival ( LRFS ; 92 % in sequential v 95 % in concurrent ; P = .76 ) , metastasis-free survival ( 87 % in sequential v 84 % in concurrent ; P = .55 ) , or overall survival ( 90 % in sequential v 91 % in concurrent ; P = .76 ) . Nevertheless , in the node-positive subgroup , the 5-year LRFS was statistically better in the concurrent arm ( 97 % in concurrent v 91 % in sequential ; P = .02 ) , corresponding to a risk of locoregional recurrence decreased by 39 % ( hazard ratio , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.38 to 0.93 ) . This treatment protocol remains an appealing clinical option for many women with operable breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence .

We aimed to estimate the effect on overdiagnosis of restricting prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) testing by age and baseline PSA . Estimates of the effects of age on overdiagnosis were based on population based incidence data from the US Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results database . To investigate the relationship between PSA and overdiagnosis , we used two separate cohorts subject to PSA testing in clinical trials ( n = 1,577 and n = 1,197 ) and a population-based cohort of Swedish men not subject to PSA-screening followed for 25 years ( n = 1,162 ) . If PSA testing had been restricted to younger men , the number of excess cases associated with the introduction of PSA in the US would have been reduced by 85 % , 68 % and 42 % for age cut-offs of 60 , 65 and 70 , respectively . The risk that a man with screen-detected cancer at age 60 would not subsequently lead to prostate cancer morbidity or mortality decreased exponentially as PSA approached conventional biopsy thresholds . For PSAs below 1 ng/ml , the risk of a positive biopsy is 65 ( 95 % CI 18.2 , 72.9 ) times greater than subsequent prostate cancer mortality . Prostate cancer overdiagnosis has a strong relationship to age and PSA level . Restricting screening in men over 60 to those with PSA above median ( > 1 ng/ml ) and screening men over 70 only in selected circumstances would importantly reduce overdiagnosis and change the ratio of benefits to harms of PSA-screening . \" \n",

Patients randomized to FAC plus G-CSF had a higher pCR rate as well as clinical complete response rate ; however , these differences were not statistically different from those with the FAC arm . Patients in the FAC + G-CSF arm had a higher delivered dose intensity of doxorubicin in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings than those in the standard FAC arm . DFS and OS times were not significantly different between the two groups . However , the OS and DFS rates were significantly higher for patients who achieved a pCR than for those who did not . Thrombocytopenia , febrile neutropenia , and infection rates were higher in the FAC + G-CSF arm . A higher delivered dose intensity of doxorubicin with the FAC + G-CSF regimen did not result in a statistically significant higher pCR rate . However , patients who achieved a pCR experienced longer DFS and OS times . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" The present study was undertaken mainly to investigate whether chemohormonal therapy with estramustine phosphate plus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist has a more beneficial effect than the hormonal therapy with flutamide plus LHRH agonist for newly diagnosed patients with metastatic prostate cancer . A total of 57 patients with metastatic prostate cancer aged 59-80 years ( median 74 years ) were entered in the study and were randomized to the treatment of estramustine phosphate ( 560 mg/day ) plus LHRH agonist ( estramustine group ) or flutamide ( 375 mg/day ) plus LHRH agonist ( flutamide group ) with stratification for the degree of performance status , histological differentiation and bone metastasis . Both of the treatment regimens were well tolerated with similar incidences of adverse drug reactions . The overall response rates ( complete response plus partial response ) at 12 weeks after treatment in the estramustine and flutamide groups were 76 and 55 % , respectively . The median time to objective progression for the estramustine group ( 25.4 months ) was longer than that of the flutamide group ( 14.6 months ) . The serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone and testosterone were significantly lower in the estramustine group . Chemohormonal therapy with estramustine phosphate plus LHRH agonist showed longer clinical progression-free survival than the hormonal therapy with flutamide plus LHRH agonist ( P = 0.03 ) , although there was no significant difference in the overall survival . A larger-scaled trial with more statistical power is required to clarify that the former regimen is more beneficial than the latter for newly diagnosed patients with advanced prostate cancer . \" \n",

            " \"content\" : \" Circulation of cancer cells in the blood is a mandatory step for metastasis , but circulating tumor cells ( CTC ) have a low metastatic efficiency in preclinical animal models . In this prospective study , we reported the clinical outcome of nonmetastatic breast cancer patients according to CTC detection . In 115 nonmetastatic patients diagnosed with large operable or locally advanced breast cancer , we prospectively detected CTC using the CellSearch system before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a phase II trial ( REMAGUS02 ) . At baseline , 23 % of patients were CTC positive , but only 10 % had > 1 CTC/7 .5 ml of blood . After a median follow-up of 36 months , CTC detection before chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for both distant metastasis-free survival  DMFS ; P = 0.01 , relative risk ( RR ) = 5.0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.4-17  and overall survival ( OS ; P = 0.007 , RR = 9 , 95 % CI 1.8-45 ) . CTC detection after chemotherapy was of less significance ( P = 0.07 and 0.09 , respectively ) . Moreover , CTC detection showed interesting characteristics as an individual predictive test for metastatic relapses ( sensibility 55 % , specificity 81 % , and global accuracy 77 % ) . Detection of > or = 1 CTC/7 .5 ml before neoadjuvant chemotherapy can accurately predict OS . Our findings may change the clinical management of nonmetastatic breast cancer and indicate that the metastatic efficiency of CTC could be higher than previously reported . \" \n",

Randomized clinical trials with stratification after surgery . NSABP trials at institutions in the United States and Canada . Data were collected on 731 eligible patients ( Protocol B-13 ) with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors who randomly received either no therapy after surgery or sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil ( M -- F ) followed by leucovorin . Data were also collected on 2834 patients ( Protocol B-14 ) with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors who randomly received either placebo or tamoxifen treatment . The percentage of patients surviving disease-free was determined through 4 years of follow-up using life-table estimates . Protocol B-13 patients received 12 courses of M -- F given intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks . Leucovorin therapy was begun 24 hours after M -- F administration . Protocol B-14 patients received 5-year treatment with either tamoxifen ( 10 mg twice daily by mouth ) or placebo . When the outcome of untreated patients in either trial was related to the stratification variables , women were found to have a disease-free survival of less than 80 % through 4 years of follow-up . This percentage is apt to decrease because the probability of treatment failure increases with time . In both trials , all subsets of women benefited from M -- F or tamoxifen therapy . The disease-free survival of all cohorts of node-negative patients with estrogen-receptor-negative or estrogen-receptor-positive tumors was poor enough to justify systemic treatment . The benefits of the therapies used are insufficient to eliminate the need for assessing putatively better regimens . \" \n",

Among 363 patients with measurable or evaluable disease , the objective response rates were higher in the elderly patients ( 46 % versus 33 % , P = 0.06 ) ; but age did not achieve significance in a logistic regression analysis ( P = 0.1 ) . The median TTP ( 10.5 months versus 6.2 months , log rank P = 0.002 ) and OS ( 35.7 months versus 28.8 months , log rank P = 0.02 ) were superior in the elderly cohort . In multivariate analysis , age at diagnosis approached statistical significance ( P = 0.055 ) for TTP but was not significant for OS ( P = 0.17 ) . Among elderly patients , disease free interval ( DFI ) ( greater than 5 years ) , dominant disease site ( soft tissue ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy , positive estrogen/progesterone receptor ( ER/PgR ) and performance status ( PS ) were independent prognostic factors .
